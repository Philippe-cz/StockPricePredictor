       "  'title': \"Should You Be Concerned About Core Laboratories N.V.'s (NYSE:CLB) ROE?\",\n",
       "  'content': \"Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB).\\n\\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Core Laboratories\\n\\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\\n\\nThe formula for ROE is:\\n\\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\\n\\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Core Laboratories is:\\n\\n5.2% = US$9.1m ÷ US$174m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).\\n\\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.05 in profit.\\n\\nDoes Core Laboratories Have A Good Return On Equity?\\n\\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Core Laboratories has a lower ROE than the average (8.2%) in the Energy Services industry classification. roe\\n\\nThat certainly isn't ideal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Core Laboratories by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\\n\\nHow Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?\\n\\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCore Laboratories' Debt And Its 5.2% ROE\\n\\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Core Laboratories, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.08. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\\n\\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\\n\\nOf course Core Laboratories may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\\n\\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

       "  'content': \"Investors interested in Oil and Gas - Field Services stocks are likely familiar with Schlumberger (SLB) and Core Laboratories (CLB). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.\\n\\nThe best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system.

Each of these companies plays in a different part of the energy sector, so it's no surprise their rally came in conjunction with a rise in oil and natural gas prices today, the result of an incrementally bullish report from the International Energy Agency (IEA).

       "  'content': \"Core Laboratories CLB reported second-quarter 2022 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 12 cents a share met the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This is attributable to the reported quarter’s revenues being in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, marginally beating the same.\\xa0 However, the bottom line worsened from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 18 cents per share. This downside is attributable to the year-over-year increase in expenses.\\n\\nThis oilfield service provider’s adjusted revenues of $120.9 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $120 million by just 0.75%. The top line also rose from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $118.7 million.\\n\\nSegmental Performance\\n\\nReservoir Description: Revenues decreased by about 3.1% to $75.8 million from $78.2 million in the second quarter of 2021 and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $79 million. Moreover, the operating income fell from $7.2 million in the year-ago period to $5.9 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.26 million due to the heavy impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and associated sanctions that slowed the demand for liquid hydrocarbon assay work in Ukraine, Russia and across parts of Europe. The segment’s operating margin of 7.8% was lower than the prior-year quarter’s 9.3%.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement:  Revenues of $45 million compared favorably with $40.5 million in the second quarter a year earlier, which is an 11.3% increase year over year. The same beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $42.29 million.\\n\\nMoreover, the segmental operating income of $4.9 million in the quarter outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an operating profit of $3.8 million. The year-ago period reported an operating income of $3.83 million. The strong numbers could be attributed to CLB’s strengths in both energetic systems and completion diagnostics, which helped clients optimize their well completions in the reported quarter.\\n\\nCore Laboratories N.V.

       "  'content': \"Core Laboratories (CLB) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.12 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nA quarter ago, it was expected that this energy services company would post earnings of $0.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.08, delivering a surprise of 33.33%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\\n\\nCore Laboratories , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $120.9 million for the quarter ended June 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.10%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $118.75 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nCore Laboratories shares have lost about 22.6% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -17.7%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Core Laboratories?\\n\\nWhile Core Laboratories has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Core Laboratories: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.20 on $131.29 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.64 on $508.05 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Field Services is currently in the top 13% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\\n\\nOne other stock from the same industry, Solaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc. (SOI), is yet to report results for the quarter ended June 2022. The results are expected to be released on August 1.\\n\\nThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +533.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 22.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.\\n\\nSolaris Oilfield Infrastructure, Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $65.7 million, up 86.8% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Turning to Core\\'s results during the second quarter of 2022, we achieved sequential improvement in revenue, operating income, operating margins and EPS; these financial improvements occurred despite somewhat greater than expected business disruptions associated with the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\\xa0 Aside from the areas affected by this conflict, Core sees improving momentum in both onshore and offshore client activity across our global operations.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict\\n\\nThe on-going geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, along with the associated European and U.S. sanctions, presents some measure of uncertainty for Core\\'s business and financial performance.\\xa0 Over the course of the second quarter of 2022, the military conflict continued and European sanctions against Russian crude oil imports were expanded.\\n\\nAs part of Core\\'s Reservoir Description laboratory network, the Company provides analytical services on crude oil, natural gas and derived products, including both reservoir condition analysis and ambient condition assay work.\\xa0 Disruptions in assay work in parts of Europe, Russia and Ukraine have persisted with the continuing conflict, while traditional supply lines of crude oil and derived products are realigning to new logistical patterns.\\xa0 Given that current global demand for these liquid hydrocarbons remain near pre-conflict levels, Core Lab expects supply patterns to continue realigning, and demand for the Company\\'s associated laboratory services to trend back toward pre-conflict levels.\\n\\nLiquidity, Free Cash Flow and Dividend\\n\\nOn 9 June 2022, Core Lab announced a $60,000,000 At-The-Market (\"ATM\") equity offering program.\\xa0 As of 27 July 2022, the Company had not sold any shares under the ATM program.\\n\\nOn 25 July 2022, the Company entered into an agreement to renew and extend its revolving credit facility (the \"Credit Facility\").\\xa0 The Credit Facility was extended through 25 July 2026 with an aggregate borrowing commitment of $135,000,000, and includes a $50,000,000 accordion option.\\xa0 Additionally, the terms of the Credit Facility provide an increase to the maximum permitted leverage ratio to be equal to (a) 2.75:1.00 through the fiscal quarter ending 30 September 2022; and (b) 2.50:1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending 31 December 2022.\\xa0 For additional information regarding the Credit Facility, see the Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by the Company on 26 July 2022.\\n\\nCore Lab initially began to refocus the use of free cash towards reducing long-term debt in the first quarter of 2020.\\xa0 The Company maintains this focused effort and continues to apply free cash primarily towards reducing long-term debt.\\xa0 Long-term debt has been reduced from $295,900,000 as of 31 December 2019 to $171,900,000 as of 30 June 2022, or a cumulative debt reduction of $124,000,000 over the last 30 months.\\xa0 Core will continue applying free cash towards reducing debt until the Company reaches its target leverage ratio (calculated as total net debt divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA) of 1.5 times or lower.\\xa0 The following graph summarizes the progress towards reducing the leverage ratio during 2021 and the impact both the Russia-Ukraine conflict and significantly higher COVID-19 cases have had on the Company\\'s leverage ratio during the first half of 2022.\\n\\nCore continues to focus on maximizing free cash flow (\"FCF\"), a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures.\\xa0 For the second quarter of 2022, cash from operations was $600,000 and capital expenditures were $3,200,000, yielding FCF of $(2,600,000).\\xa0 Cash from operations declined sequentially in the second quarter of 2022, primarily due to three factors:\\n\\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict negatively impacted the level of sales and revenue as the Company exited the first quarter and began the second quarter of 2022.\\xa0 Consequently, cash collections on accounts receivable were lower during the second quarter of 2022. Additional cash was also used to fund working capital requirements, as product sales continue to increase, supply chains remain challenged, and inflationary factors are resulting in higher levels of inventory. Cost reduction plans and associated severance obligations accrued in the first quarter of 2022 have been partially executed in the second quarter of 2022.\\xa0 Additionally, unfunded liabilities associated with certain employee retirement plans were paid from operating cash flow.\\n\\nCore expects the growth in working capital associated with higher levels of inventory to moderate, cash from operations to strengthen and the Company to generate positive free cash in future quarters.\\xa0 Core\\'s free cash will continue to be returned to its shareholders via the Company\\'s regular quarterly dividend as well as being focused towards reducing long-term debt.\\n\\nOn 27 April 2022, Core\\'s Board of Supervisory Directors (\"Board\") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock, which was paid on 31 May 2022 to shareholders of record on 9 May 2022.\\xa0 Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nOn 27 July 2022, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable in the third quarter of 2022.\\xa0 The third quarter dividend will be payable on 29 August 2022, to shareholders of record on 8 August 2022.\\xa0 Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nReservoir Description\\n\\nReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels, with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from outside the United States.\\xa0 Reservoir Description revenue in the second quarter of 2022 was $75,800,000, up 1% sequentially and down 3% year-over-year.\\xa0\\xa0 While underlying activity has improved in multiple international regions, there are two primary factors impeding the overall revenue growth: 1) the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and 2) devaluation of the Euro and British Pound.\\xa0 Revenue from operations in Russia in the second quarter of 2022 decreased approximately $800,000 sequentially, and $2,300,000 year-over-year; the revenue decline was $3,200,000 for the first half of 2022 when compared to 2021.\\xa0 Additionally, the sharp devaluation of both the Euro and British Pound during 2022 lowered revenue billed in these currencies when translated into U.S. dollars by $2,900,000 for the second quarter of 2022 and $4,800,000 for the first half of 2022, when compared to 2021.\\xa0 Operating income for the second quarter of 2022 on a GAAP basis was $5,900,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $5,000,000, yielding operating margins of 7% and sequential incremental margins of 102%.\\n\\nCore Lab\\'s eighty-plus years of expertise evaluating both subsurface geology and fluid flow through natural, porous media are providing Reservoir Description with opportunities in emerging energy transition initiatives.\\xa0 In addition to Core\\'s multi-faceted engagement in Carbon Capture and Sequestration (\"CCS\") projects, described over the past several quarters, the Company has also been engaged to evaluate subsurface cores tied to lithium extraction opportunities.\\xa0 Lithium is a valuable commodity, essential to the creation of high efficiency batteries.\\xa0 During the second quarter of 2022, Core Lab, under the direction of 3PL Operating Inc., commenced work on a multi-well core project from Railroad Valley, Nevada. 3PL Operating Inc. has targeted a Pliocene continental evaporite sequence with extensive metalliferous deposits that include: sodium, phosphorous, tungsten, boron, lithium, and other metals, potentially making the Railroad Valley deposit one of the most promising in the world of this type.\\xa0 Multiple cored intervals from the 3PL Operating, Inc. Li 10-28 and Li 11-18 wells were recovered from the subsurface and stabilized at the wellsite with Core Lab\\'s proprietary CoreSta™ technology.\\xa0 CoreSta™ is a superior preservation technology specifically invented for friable and unconsolidated formations.\\xa0 Upon arrival at the laboratory, these cores were immediately scanned using Core Lab\\'s proprietary Non-Invasive Testing and Reservoir Optimization (\"NITROSM\") technologies.\\xa0 Among these, Dual Energy Computed Tomography (\"DECT\") quickly provided experts at 3PL Operating, Inc. with lithologic information and a wide range of geological and petrophysical parameters, as well as high resolution (millimeter-scale) 3D digital images of the recovered cores.\\xa0 The cores are now progressing through the laboratory analytical program.\\xa0 Geological insights and petrophysical parameters obtained from this analytical program will provide a robust dataset of physical measurements that 3PL Operating, Inc. will use for both economic assessment of the strata and to establish optimized development strategies.\\xa0 All of the analytical data for this important project are being hosted in Core Lab\\'s secure RAPID™ database, which 3PL Operating, Inc. will use as a shared digital workspace.\\n\\nAlso in the second quarter of 2022, a client company in Latin America employed Core Lab\\'s proprietary technologies to improve the utility of heavy and extra-heavy crudes from an onshore field by blending them with lighter crude oils.\\xa0 Laboratory fluid testing, including assessment of the potential for the precipitation of organic solids, is required to verify the viability of the resultant blends.\\xa0 Responding to this need, Core Lab developed and executed a testing protocol using its proprietary imaging system for magnified viewing of fluids and fluid interactions at high temperatures and pressures.\\xa0 This technology uses two methods to evaluate and measure asphaltene flocculation: 1) a high-resolution trinocular microscope for pressurized fluid imaging (\"PFI\"), and 2) a near infrared (\"NIR\") spectrophotometer.\\xa0 Combined, these technologies determine the size and shape of flocculated particles at various temperatures and pressures.\\xa0 Successful development and deployment of these technologies, coupled with the growing market for heavy oil blends, has led to the commissioning of similar studies for additional clients in South America in the second half of 2022.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement\\n\\nProduction Enhancement operations, which are focused on complex completions in unconventional, tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S., as well as conventional offshore projects across the globe, posted second quarter 2022 revenue of $45,100,000, up 11%, both sequentially and year-over-year.\\xa0 Operating income on a GAAP basis was $4,900,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $3,900,000, yielding operating margins of 9% and sequential incremental margins of 18%.\\xa0 In the quarter, Core\\'s proprietary product sales experienced growth and market penetration in both U.S. and international markets.\\n\\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, working with a client in the North Sea, Core Lab successfully launched its innovative energetic perforating system, Helios™, aimed at improving the efficiency of plug-and-abandonment (\"P&A\") programs.\\xa0 Helios™ is a technology that creates a high-density perforation matrix, providing improved access to the cement between the outermost casing and the geologic formation.\\xa0 The optimized perforation matrix allows for greater circulation and more efficient removal of debris in the annular space during the perf and wash process.\\xa0 The operator first perforated the casing with the Helios™ technology, and then, utilizing a specialized jet wash tool, circulated fluid between the perforated casing and the formation to create a clean annulus.\\xa0 Cement plugs were subsequently set to secure the well for abandonment.\\xa0 Core\\'s Helios™ technology provided the opportunity to significantly reduce P&A expenses by decreasing rig time, saving the operator up to $4,000,000 per abandoned well versus conventional section milling. Helios™ provides Core\\'s clients with an effective and efficient solution when executing multimillion-dollar P&A programs and demonstrates how Core\\'s Production Enhancement engineers are able to adapt downhole technological advances to evolving industry needs.\\n\\nAlso during the second quarter of 2022, Core\\'s SpectraStim™, SpectraScan™, and PackScan® downhole imaging technologies were utilized in a client\\'s deepwater Gulf of Mexico well to assess a frac pack completion.\\xa0 A successful frac pack requires an effective annular pack; this includes uniform proppant placement across the annulus between the casing and the sand control screen, along with ample proppant reserve above the top of the screen, to accommodate in-filling of any initial voids in the pack.\\xa0 When a successful frac pack is placed, the well is protected from the influx of formation fines that can cut the screen, damage surface facilities, and fill the wellbore with produced solids, all of which can restrict production and potentially compromise the completion.\\xa0 Based upon traditional volumetric measurements during the frac pack treatment, the frac pack was initially interpreted to have been successfully placed.\\xa0 However, when Core\\'s Production Enhancement engineers analyzed the diagnostic data from its SpectraScan™ and PackScan® logging tools, the results revealed a major void in the annular pack, as well as inadequate proppant reserve to cover the top of the screen and/or fill the annular void.\\xa0 Core\\'s team recommended a top-off proppant pumping procedure to ensure complete screen coverage.\\xa0 A relog using Core\\'s PackScan® showed the top-off procedure was successfully completed, avoiding a multimillion-dollar remedial completion intervention.\\n\\nReturn On Invested Capital\\n\\nThe Board and the Company\\'s Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") and FCF, factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return.\\xa0 Core\\'s commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promotes capital efficiency and are designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.\\n\\nThe Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core\\'s Comp Group by Bloomberg, as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. Bloomberg\\'s calculations using the latest comparable data available indicate Core Lab\\'s ROIC of 3.8%.\\n\\nIndustry and Core Lab Outlook and Guidance\\n\\nAs we look ahead to the second half of 2022 and into 2023, Core anticipates the crude-oil commodity price will remain elevated, but to be moderately volatile as crude-oil supply and demand may be impacted by uncertainties related to slowing global economic growth.\\xa0 Crude oil supply is projected to tighten as production growth faces limitations due to prolonged underinvestment in many regions around the globe.\\xa0 These crude-oil market fundamentals are reflected in the year-over-year increase in international onshore and offshore rig counts, with oilfield drilling programs being executed and capital spending plans expanding for 2022, 2023 and beyond.\\xa0 Core sees these as leading indicators of a growing international multi-year cycle.\\n\\nWith Core Lab having more than 70% of its revenue exposed to international activity, both business segments remain active on international projects.\\xa0 The Company will have revenue opportunities when wells are completed, stimulated, and once reservoir rock or fluid samples have been collected.\\xa0 Core continues to see modest improvement in client activity across many international regions including the South Atlantic Margin, Latin America, and the Middle East.\\xa0 However, Core Lab\\'s Russia, Ukraine and Western Europe laboratory networks present some uncertainty, as the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict continues and sanctions on Russia have expanded.\\n\\nCore expects Reservoir Description revenue to improve by low-to-mid single digits in the third quarter of 2022.\\xa0 Year-to-date the international rig count has been flat.\\xa0 When the international rig count sustains improvement and Core\\'s clients drill and sample their reservoirs, Core\\'s Reservoir Description segment is expected to outperform the changes in industry activity levels.\\n\\nCore\\'s Production Enhancement segment is more exposed to U.S. onshore activity and typically correlates to well stimulation and completion programs.\\xa0 The third quarter 2022 U.S. rig count is projected to increase sequentially, however, the rate of growth for completions may potentially be limited by the availability of third party frac equipment and crews.\\xa0 Consequently, Core\\'s Production Enhancement\\xa0 segment revenue is projected to increase sequentially by mid-to-high single digits.\\n\\nFor the third quarter of 2022, Core projects continued improvement in U.S. activity and moderate improvement in international, offshore and deepwater markets.\\xa0 The realignment of crude-oil supply lines is projected to continue into the third quarter of 2022, having a sequential positive impact on Reservoir Description\\'s assay laboratory testing in the affected regions.\\xa0 Core projects third quarter 2022 revenue to range from $123,000,000 to $129,000,000 and operating income of $10,100,000 to $13,300,000, yielding operating margins of approximately 9%.\\xa0 EPS for the third quarter of 2022 is expected to be $0.13 to $0.18.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s third quarter 2022 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange.\\xa0 Third quarter 2022 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.\\n\\nEarnings Call Scheduled\\n\\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core\\'s second quarter 2022 earnings announcement.\\xa0 The call will begin at 7:30 a.m. CDT / 2:30 p.m. CEST on Thursday, 28 July 2022.\\xa0 To listen to the call, please go to Core\\'s website at www.corelab.com.\\n\\nCore Laboratories N.V. is a leading provider of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products used to optimize petroleum reservoir performance.

       "  'title': 'Earnings Preview: Core Laboratories (CLB) Q2 Earnings Expected to Decline',\n",
       "  'content': \"Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when Core Laboratories (CLB) reports results for the quarter ended June 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\\n\\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on July 27, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis energy services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.13 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -27.8%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $121.94 million, up 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.68% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Core Laboratories?\\n\\nFor Core Laboratories, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -15.39%.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\\n\\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Core Laboratories will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\\n\\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\\n\\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\\n\\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Core Laboratories would post earnings of $0.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.08, delivering a surprise of +33.33%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\\n\\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\\n\\nCore Laboratories doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\\n\\nExpected Results of an Industry Player\\n\\nAnother stock from the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, Liberty Oilfield Services (LBRT), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.18 per share for the quarter ended June 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +162.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $869.09 million, up 49.5% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nOver the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Liberty Oilfield Services has remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 46.25%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.\\n\\nWhen combined with a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), this Earnings ESP indicates that Liberty Oilfield Services will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.\\n\\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'content': 'Investors in Core Laboratories N.V. CLB need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Sep 16, 2022 $15.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.\\n\\nWhat is Implied Volatility?\\n\\nImplied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.\\n\\nWhat do the Analysts Think?\\n\\nClearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Core Laboratories shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Core Laboratories is a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) in the Oil and Gas - Field Services industry that ranks in the Top 16% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 14 cents per share to 13 cents in that period.\\n\\nGiven the way analysts feel about Core Laboratories right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.\\n\\nLooking to Trade Options?\\n\\nCheck out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

       "  'title': \"Here's What's Concerning About Core Laboratories' (NYSE:CLB) Returns On Capital\",\n",
       "  'content': \"When researching a stock for investment, what can tell us that the company is in decline? Businesses in decline often have two underlying trends, firstly, a declining return on capital employed (ROCE) and a declining base of capital employed. This indicates to us that the business is not only shrinking the size of its net assets, but its returns are falling as well. So after we looked into Core Laboratories (NYSE:CLB), the trends above didn't look too great.\\n\\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\\n\\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Core Laboratories:\\n\\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\\n\\n0.065 = US$32m ÷ (US$585m - US$100m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).\\n\\nThus, Core Laboratories has an ROCE of 6.5%.  On its own that's a low return, but compared to the average of 5.4% generated by the Energy Services industry, it's much better.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Core Laboratories  roce\\n\\nIn the above chart we have measured Core Laboratories' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Core Laboratories here  for free.\\n\\nWhat Can We Tell From Core Laboratories' ROCE Trend?\\n\\nIn terms of Core Laboratories' historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. About five years ago, returns on capital were 19%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect Core Laboratories to turn into a multi-bagger.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWhat We Can Learn From Core Laboratories' ROCE\\n\\nAll in all, the lower returns from the same amount of capital employed aren't exactly signs of a compounding machine. We expect this has contributed to the stock plummeting 81% during the last five years. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.\\n\\nOn a final note, we found 3 warning signs for Core Laboratories (1 is potentially serious)  you should be aware of.\\n\\nWhile Core Laboratories may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

The International Small Companies composite declined 13.4% gross of fees in the first quarter, well beyond the 6.4% decline of the MSCI ACWI ex-US Small Cap Index.

       "  'content': 'The oil market is currently going through one of the most turbulent periods since the infamous March 2020 collapse, as investors continue to grapple with recessionary fears. Oil prices have continued sliding in the wake of the central bank deciding to hike the interest rate by a record-high 75 basis points, with WTI futures for July settlement were quoted at $104.48/barrel on Wednesday\\'s intraday session, down 4.8% on the day and 8.8% below last week\\'s peak. Meanwhile, Brent crude futures for August settlement were trading 4% lower in Wednesday\\'s session at $110.10/barrel, a good 9.4% below last week\\'s peak.\\n\\nWhile crude prices have taken a big hit, oil and gas stocks have fared even worse, with energy equities experiencing nearly double the selling pressure compared to WTI crude.\\n\\n\"Year to date, Energy is the sole sector in the green ... but concern now is that fact that Bears are coming after winners, thus they may take Energy down. The Energy Sector undercut its rising 50 DMA and now looks lower to the rising 200 DMA, which is currently -9% below last Friday\\'s close. Crude Oil is sitting on its rising 50 DMA and has a stronger technical pattern,\" MKM Chief Market Technician J.C. O\\'Hara has written in a note to clients.\\n\\n\"Normally we like to buy pullbacks within uptrends. Our concern at this point in the Bear market cycle is that leadership stocks are often the last domino to fall, and thus profit taking is the greater motivation. The fight-or-flight mentality currently favors flight, so we would rather downsize our positioning in Energy stocks and harvest some of the outsized gains achieved following the March 2020 COVID low,\" he has added.\\n\\nRelated: Russian Refinery On Fire After Kamikaze Drone Strike\\n\\nAccording to O\\'Hara\\'s chart analysis, these energy stocks have the greatest downside risk:\\n\\nAntero Midstream (NYSE:AM), Archrock (NYSE:AROC), Baker Hughes (NASDAQ:BKR), DMC Global (NASDAQ:BOOM), ChampionX (NASDAQ:CHX), Core Labs (NYSE:CLB), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Callon Petroleum (NYSE:CPE), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Dril-Quip (NYSE:DRQ), Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN), EOG Resources (NYSE:EOG), Equitrans Midstream (NYSE:ETRN), Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG), Green Plains (NASDAQ:GPRE), Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), Helix Energy (NYSE:HLX), World Fuel Services (NYSE:INT), Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI), NOV (NYSE:NOV), Oceaneering International (NYSE:OII), Oil States International (NYSE:OIS), ONEOK (NYSE:OKE), ProPetro (NYSE:PUMP), Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), RPC (NYSE:RES), REX American Resources (NYSE:REX), Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), U.S Silica (NYSE:SLCA), Bristow Group (NYSE:VTOL), and The Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nTight Supplies\\n\\nWhereas the bear camp, including the likes of \\xa0O\\'Hara, believes that the oil price rally is over, the bulls have stood their ground and view the latest selloff as a temporary blip.\\n\\nIn a recent interview, Michael O\\'Brien, Head of Core Canadian Equities at TD Asset Management, told TD Wealth\\'s Kim Parlee that the oil supply/demand fundamentals remain rock solid thanks in large part to years of underinvestment both by private producers and NOCs.\\n\\nYou can blame ESG—as well as expectations for a lower-for-longer oil price environment over the past couple of years—for taking a toll on the capital spending of exploration and production (E&P) companies. Indeed, actual and announced capex cuts have fallen below the minimum required levels to offset depletion, let alone meet any expected growth. Oil and gas spending fell off a cliff from its peak in 2014, with global spending by exploration and production (E&P) firms hitting a nadir in 2020 to a 13-year low of just $450 billion.\\n\\nEven with higher oil prices, energy companies are only increasing capital spending gradually with the majority preferring to return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Others like BP Plc. (NYSE:BP) and Shell Plc. (NYSE:SHEL) have already committed to long-term production cuts and will struggle to reverse their trajectories.\\n\\nNorway-based energy consultancy Rystad Energy has warned that Big Oil could see its proven reserves run out in less than 15 years, thanks to produced volumes not being fully replaced with new discoveries.\\n\\nAccording to Rystad, proven oil and gas reserves by the so-called Big Oil companies namely ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), BP Plc., Shell, Chevron (NYSE:CVX), TotalEnergies ( NYSE:TTE), and Eni S.p.A (NYSE:E) are all falling, as produced volumes are not being fully replaced with new discoveries.\\n\\nSource: Oil and Gas Journal\\n\\nMassive impairment charges has seen Big Oil\\'s proven reserves drop by 13 billion boe, good for ~15% of its stock levels in the ground. Rystad now says that the remaining reserves are set to run out in less than 15 years, unless Big Oil makes more commercial discoveries quickly.\\n\\nThe main culprit: Rapidly shrinking exploration investments.\\n\\nGlobal oil and gas companies cut their capex by a staggering 34% in 2020 in response to shrinking demand and investors growing wary of persistently poor returns by the sector.\\n\\nExxonMobil, whose proven reserves shrank by 7 billion boe in 2020, or 30%, from 2019 levels, was the worst hit after major reductions in Canadian oil sands and U.S. shale gas properties.\\n\\nShell, meanwhile, saw its proven reserves fall by 20% to 9 billion boe last year; Chevron lost 2 billion boe of proven reserves due to impairment charges, while BP lost 1 boe. Only Total and Eni have avoided reductions in proven reserves over the past decade.\\n\\nThe result? The U.S. shale industry has only managed to bump up 2022 crude output by just 800,000 b/d, while OPEC has consistently struggled to meet its targets. In fact, the situation has become so bad for the 13 countries that make up the cartel that OPEC+ produced 2.695 million barrels per day below its crude oil targets in the month of May.\\n\\nExxon CEO Darren Woods has predicted that the crude markets will remain tight for up to five years, with time needed for firms to \"catch up\" on the investments needed to ensure supply can meet demand.\\n\\n\"Supplies will remain tight and continue supporting high oil prices. The norm for ICE Brent is still around the $120/bbl mark,\" PVM analyst Stephen Brennock has told Reuters after the latest crude selloff.\\n\\nIn other words, the oil price rally might be far from over, and the latest correction might offer fresh entry points for investors.\\n\\nCredit Suisse energy analyst Manav Gupta has weighed in on the stocks with the most exposure to oil and gas prices.

       "  'title': \"Core Laboratories' (NYSE:CLB) earnings have declined over five years, contributing to shareholders 71% loss\",\n",
       "  'content': 'It\\'s nice to see the Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) share price up 12% in a week. But will that repair the damage for the weary investors who have owned this stock as it declined over half a decade? Probably not. Five years have seen the share price descend precipitously, down a full 73%. While the recent increase might be a green shoot, we\\'re certainly hesitant to rejoice. The fundamental business performance will ultimately determine if the turnaround can be sustained.\\n\\nThe recent uptick of 12% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let\\'s take a lot at historical fundamentals.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Core Laboratories\\n\\nTo paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it\\'s a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\\n\\nLooking back five years, both Core Laboratories\\' share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 33% per year. The share price decline of 23% per year isn\\'t as bad as the EPS decline. So investors might expect EPS to bounce back -- or they may have previously foreseen the EPS decline. The high P/E ratio of 131.21 suggests that shareholders believe earnings will grow in the years ahead.\\n\\nThe graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\\n\\nIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our freereport on Core Laboratories\\' earnings, revenue and cash flow.\\n\\nWhat About Dividends?\\n\\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It\\'s fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Core Laboratories, it has a TSR of -71% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there\\'s no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA Different Perspective\\n\\nWhile the broader market lost about 10% in the twelve months, Core Laboratories shareholders did even worse, losing 34% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there\\'s a good opportunity. Unfortunately, last year\\'s performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 11% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It\\'s always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Core Laboratories better, we need to consider many other factors. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we\\'ve spotted  4 warning signs for Core Laboratories  (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.\\n\\nWe will like Core Laboratories better if we see some big insider buys.

       "  'title': 'Core Laboratories (CLB) Up 2.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Continue?',\n",
       "  'content': \"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Core Laboratories (CLB). Shares have added about 2.6% in that time frame, outperforming the S&P 500.\\n\\nWill the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Core Laboratories due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\\n\\nCore Labs' Q1 Earnings & Sales Beat Estimates\\n\\nCore Laboratories reported first-quarter 2022 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 8 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. This is attributable to a year-over-year increase in revenues by 6%. However, the bottom line worsened from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 15 cents per share. This downside is attributable to the year-over-year increase in expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis oilfield service provider’s adjusted revenues of $115.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112 million by about 2.9%. The top line also rose from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $108.4 million.\\n\\nSegmental Performance\\n\\nReservoir Description: Revenues decreased by about 2.3% to $74.8 million from $76.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 but narrowly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74 million. Moreover, the operating income fell from $10 million in the year-ago period to $361,000 and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.2 million due to the heavy impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a greater-than-expected COVID-19 caseload and a typical seasonal decline in revenues. The segment’s operating margin of 0.5% was lower than the prior-year quarter’s 13.1%.\\r\\n\\r\\nProduction Enhancement: Revenues of $40.5 million compared favorably with $31.9 million in the first quarter a year earlier, which is a 27.1% increase year over year. The same lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.47 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoreover, the segmental operating loss of $918,000 in the quarter underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an operating profit $5.55 million. The year-ago period reported an operating income of $1.6 million. The weak numbers could be attributed to a decrease in international product sales, including the suspension of product sales in Ukraine.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFinancials and Dividend\\n\\nAs of Mar 31, 2022, Core Labs had cash and cash equivalents worth $22 million and long-term debt of $188.6 million. The company’s debt-to-capitalization was 53.3%.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the reported quarter, CLB generated $5.3 million of operating cash and its capital expenditure totaled $2.3 million. This, in turn, led to $3 million of free cash flow.\\r\\n\\r\\nCore Labs’ board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of a cent per share on the company's common stock, payable on May 31, 2022 to all shareholders of record as of May 9, 2022.\\n\\n2022 Outlook\\n\\nFor the second quarter of 2022, Core Labs’ revenues are anticipated in the $119-$125 million range, while the operating income is estimated in the $9.4-$11.8 million band.\\r\\n\\r\\nEarnings per share for the second quarter of 2022 are expected between 12 cents and 16 cents.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Core Labs’ prospects are directly associated with expanding its client activity and tapping new geographies, it continues to focus on the ongoing development of the new client-driven technologies and geographical exploration along with a deepened concentration on digitization and automation throughout its business.\\n\\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\\n\\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision.\\n\\nThe consensus estimate has shifted -12.77% due to these changes.\\n\\nVGM Scores\\n\\nAt this time, Core Laboratories has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.\\n\\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C.

       "  'title': 'A Look At The Fair Value Of Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB)',\n",
       "  'content': 'Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today\\'s value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There\\'s really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\\n\\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company\\'s value, and a DCF is just one method. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Core Laboratories\\n\\nStep by step through the calculation\\n\\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company\\'s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\\n\\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\\n\\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\\n\\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$35.7m US$54.4m US$72.0m US$81.0m US$88.0m US$93.2m US$97.6m US$101.4m US$104.7m US$107.7m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 5.91% Est @ 4.72% Est @ 3.88% Est @ 3.29% Est @ 2.88% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9%  US$32.8 US$45.8 US$55.7 US$57.6 US$57.4 US$55.8 US$53.7 US$51.2 US$48.5 US$45.9\\n\\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\\r\\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$504m\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country\\'s GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (1.9%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year \\'growth\\' period, we discount future cash flows to today\\'s value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.\\n\\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$108m× (1 + 1.9%) ÷ (8.9%– 1.9%) = US$1.6b\\n\\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.6b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$668m\\n\\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.2b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$26.0, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\\n\\nThe assumptions\\n\\nThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don\\'t have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Core Laboratories as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\\'ve used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.650. Beta is a measure of a stock\\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\\n\\nMoving On:\\n\\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you\\'d apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company\\'s valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

       "  'content': \"Core Laboratories’ CLB stock has gone down 3% since the first-quarter 2022 earnings announcement on Apr 27.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe stock price slumped despite Core Labs’ first-quarter sales and revenues beating the consensus mark. The performance could be attributed to the poor outcome of the Production Enhancement unit and much increased year-over-year expenses.\\r\\n\\r\\nBehind the Earnings Headlines\\r\\n\\r\\nCore Labs reported first-quarter 2022 results, wherein adjusted earnings of 8 cents a share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. This is attributable to a year-over-year increase in revenues by 6%. However, the bottom line worsened from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 15 cents per share. This downside is attributable to the year-over-year increase in expenses.\\n\\nThis oilfield service provider’s adjusted revenues of $115.3 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $112 million by about 2.9%. The top line also rose from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $108.4 million.\\n\\nCore Laboratories N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Core Laboratories N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nCore Laboratories N.V. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Core Laboratories N.V. Quote\\n\\nSegmental Performance\\n\\nReservoir Description:Revenues decreased by about 2.3% to $74.8 million from $76.5 million in the first quarter of 2021 but narrowly beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74 million. Moreover, the operating income fell from $10 million in the year-ago period to $361,000 and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.2 million due to the heavy impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a greater-than-expected COVID-19 caseload and a typical seasonal decline in revenues. The segment’s operating margin of 0.5% was lower than the prior-year quarter’s 13.1%.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement:  Revenues of $40.5 million compared favorably with $31.9 million in the first quarter a year earlier, which is a 27.1% increase year over year. The same lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.47 million.\\n\\nMoreover, the segmental operating loss of $918,000 in the quarter underperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of an operating profit $5.55 million. The year-ago period reported an operating income of $1.6 million. The weak numbers could be attributed to a decrease in international product sales, including the suspension of product sales in Ukraine.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nFinancials and Dividend\\n\\nAs of Mar 31, 2022, Core Labs had cash and cash equivalents worth $22 million and long-term debt of $188.6 million. The company’s debt-to-capitalization was 53.3%.\\n\\nIn the reported quarter, CLB generated $5.3 million of operating cash and its capital expenditure totaled $2.3 million. This, in turn, led to $3 million of free cash flow.\\n\\nCore Labs’ board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of a cent per share on the company's common stock, payable on May 31, 2022 to all shareholders of record as of May 9, 2022.\\n\\n2022 Outlook\\n\\nFor the second quarter of 2022, Core Labs’ revenues are anticipated in the $119-$125 million range, while the operating income is estimated in the $9.4-$11.8 million band.\\n\\nEarnings per share for the second quarter of 2022 are expected between 12 cents and 16 cents.\\n\\nAs Core Labs’ prospects are directly associated with expanding its client activity and tapping new geographies, it continues to focus on the ongoing development of the new client-driven technologies and geographical exploration along with a deepened concentration on digitization and automation throughout its business.\\n\\nZacks Rank & Key Picks\\n\\nCore Labs currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked players from the energy space that warrant a look include PDC Energy PDCE, PBF Energy PBF and Vista Oil & Gas VIST, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\\n\\nPDC Energy’s stock has gone up 81.9% in a year.

This compares to earnings of $0.15 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 33.33%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this energy services company would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering no surprise.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\\n\\nCore Laboratories , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $115.3 million for the quarter ended March 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.29%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $108.38 million.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Core Laboratories: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Operating income, ex-items, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $7,200,000, yielding operating margins of 6.2% and earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\"), ex-items, of $0.08. During the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded: 1) approximately $3,900,000 of non-cash stock compensation expense associated with full recognition of awards when employees reach their eligible retirement age, 2) severance and facility consolidation expense of $3,300,000, and 3) bad debt expense of $800,000 for doubtful accounts receivable due from Ukraine clients. The severance and facility consolidation expense is associated with Core\\'s continuing strategic objective to improve operational efficiencies and optimize Core\\'s global network to support its clients. In addition to the anticipated typical seasonal decline in the first quarter of 2022, financial results were further impacted by higher-than-expected business disruptions associated with COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict.

During the first quarter of 2022, two significant events impacted Core\\'s financial results: 1) the continued outbreak and global spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19, which generated a significantly greater impact than initially anticipated, and 2) business disruptions associated with the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which negatively impacted both business segments.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDespite these headwinds, we were pleased to announce an emerging growth opportunity during the first quarter, as we formalized our collaboration with Talos Energy Inc. (\"Talos\") to deliver CCS solutions aimed at reducing industrial carbon emissions. This alliance, built on complementary technical strengths in subsurface characterization and reservoir optimization, will enhance the speed at which scalable, reliable and sustainable carbon sequestration solutions can be delivered to the market. We are excited about the positive impact this work will ultimately have, by both returning value to our shareholders and advancing CO2 emission reduction initiatives. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2022, Core Lab inaugurated a joint-industry CCS consortium. Core Lab has a long history of conducting successful multi-company projects aimed at evaluating oil and gas opportunities. This new consortium will enhance the nascent CCS industry\\'s knowledge of the geotechnical challenges associated with subsurface storage of CO2, with a focus on reservoir capacity, injectivity and containment integrity, all of which align with Core Lab\\'s expertise in subsurface characterization. As government regulations encourage investment in CCS projects, Core Lab will see growing opportunities to leverage this expertise.\\n\\nLooking forward, Core Lab\\'s outlook for the remainder of 2022 remains positive with sequential improvement expected in the second quarter followed by further acceleration during the second half of the year. Furthermore, we continue to anticipate a multi-year international cycle supported by market fundamentals.\"\\n\\nRussia-Ukraine Conflict and COVID-19 Business Impact\\n\\nThe on-going geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine is adversely impacting service revenue and product sales, affecting both business segments. To date, Reservoir Description has been more heavily impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As part of Core\\'s global laboratory network, the Company provides analytical services on crude oil, natural gas and derived products, including both reservoir condition analysis and ambient condition assay work. Business interruptions arising from cyber-attacks against third party facilities began prior to direct military engagement; these cyber-attacks disrupted demand for crude-oil assay work, particularly in Europe. As direct military conflict ensued, disruptions in crude-oil assay work in Europe, Russia and Ukraine were even further negatively impacted. Traditional supply chains associated with the movement of crude oil are realigning to new logistical patterns in response to both the military conflict and the economic sanctions imposed on Russia. Given that global demand for crude oil and natural gas has not meaningfully diminished, Core Lab expects supply channels to realign, and the demand for the Company\\'s associated laboratory services to resume, albeit with a different geographic spread. Completion product sales delivered through Core\\'s Production Enhancement segment directly into Ukraine have also been suspended. Core has historically generated approximately 5% to 8% of its total revenue from Russia, Ukraine and the Southeastern European region.\\n\\nAlso during the first quarter of 2022, global COVID-19 caseloads rose very sharply as the Omicron variant spread across all regions. More than 15% of Core Lab\\'s employees tested positive for COVID-19 during the first quarter. In addition, other staff were subject to quarantine restrictions. As a business that runs on people more than, for example, equipment rental day rates, this higher-than-expected surge in COVID-19 cases caused disruption to the Company\\'s operations; concurrently, clients were also impacted by the spike in COVID-19 cases and quarantine requirements, which delayed progress on projects.\\n\\nReservoir Description\\n\\nReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels, with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from outside the U.S. Reservoir Description revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $74,800,000, down 7% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Operating income for the first quarter of 2022 on a GAAP basis was $400,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $3,900,000, yielding operating margins of 5%. Cost of operations in the first quarter of 2022 increased due to restoration of employee salary costs and continued operational inefficiencies associated with the global pandemic. In addition to the greater-than-expected COVID-19 caseload and typical seasonal decline in revenue, first quarter 2022 Reservoir Description results were negatively impacted by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. The military conflict disrupted traditional patterns of crude oil movement in Russia, Ukraine and Europe and negatively affected demand for Core Lab\\'s crude oil assay work in these regions.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Core conducted a large core and reservoir data analysis workshop for Kuwait Oil Company (\"KOC\"). This comprehensive five-day workshop was the culmination of a multi-year, multi-well analytical program that included proprietary Core Lab technologies and interpretation techniques, focused on hydrocarbon potential and pay recognition in prospective unconventional and tight conventional reservoir targets. Core leveraged its proprietary, web-enabled RAPID™ database to organize and analyze well and laboratory data. Fracture analysis and interpretation was conducted utilizing Core\\'s Dual-Energy Computed Tomography Scanner, which allowed for 3D visualization of conventional cores and calibration of third-party borehole image logs. Advanced petrophysical log models were developed that included fluid flow prediction and assessment of well productivity. KOC stated that the workshop was a great success and their technical teams are able to incorporate and build on the recently concluded work. An expansion of the study is currently being planned to include other fields and also to address additional reservoir challenges.\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Core Lab, under the direction of The CarbonNet Project commenced the next phase of advanced rock property analysis on conventional core extracted from the Gular-1 appraisal well, located in the Gippsland Basin, offshore southeast Australia. The CarbonNet Project is expected to be a world-class, CCS center to manage future carbon emissions from industrial sources in South East Australia. In a recent press release, the CarbonNet Project announced, \"The CarbonNet Project is advancing the science and viability for establishing a commercial-scale carbon capture and sequestration network.\" If successful, the network would bring together multiple carbon dioxide (\"CO2\") capture projects in Victoria\\'s Latrobe Valley, transporting CO2 via a shared pipeline and injecting it into deep, underground, offshore storage sites in the Bass Strait. During this phase of the CarbonNet Project analytical program, Core Lab is employing proprietary technologies to provide detailed insight into rock and pore system properties, rock-fluid compatibility, and fluid flow behaviors, as well as geomechanical properties. The results of the advanced testing will be utilized to expand the CarbonNet Project\\'s understanding of the CO2 storage capacity, optimal methodologies for injecting CO2 and the integrity of the seal rock, all of which are critical to evaluating and reducing geologic risk associated with the project. A substantial risk in any CO2 sequestration project is failing to properly assess the complexity of the targeted geologic subsurface formation and the in-situ pore fluids. Core Lab\\'s eighty-plus years of expertise in evaluating subsurface geology and fluid flow through natural porous media is essential for accessing these types of CO2 sequestration projects.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement\\n\\nProduction Enhancement operations, which are focused on complex completions in unconventional, tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S., as well as conventional offshore projects across the globe, posted first quarter 2022 revenue of $40,500,000, down 10% sequentially and up 27% year-over-year. Operating loss on a GAAP basis was $900,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $3,100,000, yielding operating margins of 8%. Production Enhancement\\'s financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 was impacted by a sequential decrease of 19% in international product sales, which includes the suspension of product sales into Ukraine. However, energetic product sales into the U.S. market increased over 7% sequentially.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement has been a long-standing innovator of both energetic system products and diagnostic services, which aim to improve completions and monitor well performance. With Core\\'s combined expertise in energetic systems and design and engineering of diagnostic technologies, Core Lab is pleased to announce the introduction of its patent-pending GoTrace™ product solution. GoTrace™ is an innovative, organically-developed, technology that directly incorporates Core\\'s diagnostic services into the Company\\'s energetic system products. The integration of Core\\'s proprietary perforating products and diagnostic tracers into one system allows Core\\'s clients to cost-effectively introduce unique tracers into specific perf clusters simultaneous with the perforating process. By providing diagnostic evaluation at the cluster level, clients gain significantly more granularity when evaluating a completion program, as compared to stage-level diagnostic treatment alternatives. Recently, TotalEngeries SE utilized Core\\'s GoTrace™ technology in a recompletion project in the Barnett Shale. By deploying GoTrace™, TotalEnergies SE was able to determine whether the new perforation clusters were effectively stimulated. Core\\'s diagnostic analysis of the restimulation treatment confirmed the clusters created with GoTrace™ were effectively stimulated, thus optimizing well performance.\\n\\nFree Cash Flow and Dividend\\n\\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, Core continued to generate free cash flow (\"FCF\"), with cash from operations of $5,300,000 and capital expenditures of $2,300,000, yielding FCF of $3,000,000. Core\\'s free cash will continue to be returned to its shareholders via the Company\\'s regular quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, as well as being applied towards reducing long-term debt.\\n\\nOn 2 February 2022, Core\\'s Board of Supervisory Directors (\"Board\") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock, which was paid on 7 March 2022 to shareholders of record on 14 February 2022. Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nOn 27 April 2022, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable in the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter dividend will be payable on 31 May 2022, to shareholders of record on 9 May 2022. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nReturn On Invested Capital\\n\\nThe Board and the Company\\'s Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") and FCF, factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return. Core\\'s commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promotes capital efficiency and are designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.\\n\\nThe Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core\\'s Comp Group by Bloomberg, as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. Bloomberg\\'s calculations using the latest comparable data available indicate that Core Lab\\'s ROIC of 6.7% is one of the highest for all major companies in the oilfield service Comp Group.\\n\\nIndustry and Core Lab Outlook and Guidance\\n\\nAs the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict continues and the sanctions on Russia have expanded, the global crude-oil market continues to tighten, with demand for crude oil approaching pre-COVID-19 levels, resulting in higher crude-oil commodity prices. With consistent elevated crude-oil commodity prices and the tightening of crude-oil supply, the industry is preparing for an increase in activity, driven by demand, resulting in a multi-year cycle. These crude-oil market fundamentals are reflected in the gradual increase in the international rig count, with more oilfield equipment coming under contract and expanded capital spending plans for 2022. Core sees these as leading indicators of a growing international cycle.\\n\\nWith Core Lab having more than 70% of its revenue exposed to international activity, both business segments remain active on international projects. As additional field development projects emerge, wells need to be drilled and reservoir rock and fluid sampled before Reservoir Description participates in the cycle. The expansion of international developments, both short and long-cycle projects, provides growth opportunities for both segments into 2022 and beyond, with a particular focus on the South Atlantic Margin, Latin America, and the Middle East.\\n\\nCore\\'s North America revenue is correlated with completion and stimulation events and large-scale reservoir rock and reservoir fluid characterization studies, rather than with immediate changes in rig count. Wells need to be drilled and subsequently completed, stimulated, and cored, or have reservoir fluid samples collected, before Core can realize a revenue event. Core expects to continue benefiting from increased U.S. onshore activity, albeit led by private operators and somewhat moderated by capital discipline for larger publicly-traded operators.\\n\\nFor the second quarter of 2022, Core projects its business to improve, primarily from increasing activity levels in the U.S. and moderate improvement in international, offshore and deepwater markets, potentially offset by uncertainties associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Core projects second quarter 2022 revenue to range from $119,000,000 to $125,000,000 and operating income of $9,400,000 to $11,800,000, yielding operating margins of approximately 9%. EPS for the second quarter of 2022 is expected to be $0.12 to $0.16.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s second quarter 2022 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. Second quarter 2022 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.\\n\\nEarnings Call Scheduled\\n\\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core\\'s first quarter 2022 earnings announcement. The call will begin at 7:30 a.m. CDT / 2:30 p.m. CEST on Thursday, 28 April 2022.

       "  'title': 'Earnings Preview: Core Laboratories (CLB) Q1 Earnings Expected to Decline',\n",
       "  'content': \"The market expects Core Laboratories (CLB) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\\n\\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 27. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis energy services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $111.63 million, up 3% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 20.29% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\\n\\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Chart for CLB\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Core Laboratories?\\n\\nFor Core Laboratories, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -26.36%.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\\n\\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Core Laboratories will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\\n\\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\\n\\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\\n\\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Core Laboratories would post earnings of $0.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.20, delivering no surprise.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\\n\\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\\n\\nCore Laboratories doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\\n\\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'content': 'Ariel Investments, an investment management firm, published its “Ariel Fund & Ariel Appreciation Fund” fourth quarter 2021 investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. For the three months ending December 31, 2021, Ariel Fund and Ariel Appreciation Fund lagged their primary value benchmarks. This was largely due to some weakness among our highest conviction consumer names. Still, Ariel Appreciation Fund solidly outpaced its core benchmark during the quarter and landed between the value and core indices for the full year. Meanwhile, Ariel Fund crushed both its primary and secondary benchmarks for the year. Spare some time to check the fund’s top 5 holdings to have a clue about their top bets for 2022.\\n\\nAriel Investments, in its Q4 2021 investor letter, mentioned Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) and discussed its stance on the firm. Founded in 1936, Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) is an Amsterdam, Netherlands-based petroleum industry company with a $1.3 billion market capitalization, and is currently spearheaded by its CEO, Lawrence Bruno. Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) delivered a 31.33% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 0.93%. The stock closed at $29.30 per share on March 21, 2022.\\n\\nHere is what Ariel Investments has to say about Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:\\n\\n\"In Ariel Appreciation Fund, we did not eliminate any names but did initiate a position in premier oil services company, Core Laboratories N.V. (CLB). In response to recent headwinds within the COVID-19 operating environment, management announced additional cost cuts which should help the company achieve its free cash flow targets and reduce debt.

       "  'title': 'Oil &amp; Gas Stock Roundup: Oilfield Service Giants Decide to Move From Russia',\n",
       "  'content': 'It was a week when oil prices registered further decline but natural gas futures rose.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the news front, oilfield service providers Halliburton HAL, Schlumberger SLB and Core Laboratories CLB provided an update on their Russian operations. Announcements from The Williams Companies WMB and Eni SpA E also made it to the headlines.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, it was a mixed seven-day period for the sector. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures lost 4.2% to close at $104.70 per barrel but natural gas prices rose 2.9% to end at $4.863 per million British thermal units (MMBtu). In particular, the oil market extended its decline from the previous week.\\r\\n\\r\\nOil logged its first back-to-back weekly decline this year on heightened diplomatic efforts to end the Ukraine crisis and continued flow of energy exports from Russia even as Western sanctions increase in scale and scope. The commodity’s negative price reaction was also blamed on a report from the Energy Information Administration (\"EIA\") showing addition to crude stockpiles. Finally, China’s renewed restrictions on movement to curb the latest COVID spurt and the possible demand inmplications from that contributed to the decline\\r\\n\\r\\nMeanwhile, natural gas tallied a weekly gain following a higher-than-expected decrease in supplies and bullish weather forecasts.\\n\\nRecap of the Week’s Most-Important Stories\\n\\n1. Halliburton recently said that it has decided to suspend future business in Russia with immediate effect, citing a wave of sanctions imposed after Moscow attacked Ukraine. The oilfield service behemoth is also preparing to wind down its remaining operations in the nation to protest the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\\r\\n\\r\\nLarger rival Schlumberger followed suit by announcing a stoppage in investment and technology supply to its Russian venture while closely monitoring the “dynamic” situation. SLB’s disclosure heightened its concerns about the war.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike Halliburton, Schlumberger too raised red flags about the conflict and worries about the safety of workers, to go with the complications of doing business in the country as Western sanctions increase in scale and scope. (Why are Halliburton, Schlumberger Pulling Back from Russia?)\\r\\n\\r\\n2.\\xa0\\xa0 Core Laboratories warned of falling earnings and revenues as the Russia-Ukraine crisis began to bite. Citing an impact on service revenues and product sales, the firm lowered its first-quarter revenue guidance to $110-$113 million from the prior $117-$122 million and its EPS view to 5-8 cents from 16-20 cents. Meanwhile, operating margin is now expected in the range of 5-6%, compared with 11% earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe company said that cyberattacks on third-party units — prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — hampered business by scuttling demand for crude-oil assay work, especially in Europe. According to CLB, such work continues to suffer in Europe, Russia and Ukraine as the war drags on. Core Laboratories further informed that it has put its Ukrainian operations on hold in order to protect workers, while suspending production sales delivery in the country.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nIn addition to the geopolitical risks, CLB suffered operational hiccups after a much larger-than-usual number of its employees tested positive for COVID during the first quarter. The surge in cases not only led to lockdowns and government-imposed curbs but also deferred certain client-backed projects. (Core Labs Hit by Russia Conflict, Pegs Down Q1 View)\\r\\n\\r\\n3\\xa0\\xa0 Tulsa, OK-based pipeline operator, Williams Companies, stated that it signed an agreement to buy Trace Midstream’s Haynesville gathering and processing assets in a deal valued at $950 million. This transaction with Trace, which is a portfolio company of Quantum Energy Partners, is done to enlarge Williams’ footprint in Louisiana’s Haynesville Shale.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company mentioned that this development increases its gathering capacity in Haynesville to more than 4 billion cubic feet a day (Bcf/d) from 1.8 Bcf/d. WMB anticipates the purchase to result in an investment value of roughly six times the 2023 EBITDA.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\\r\\n\\r\\nPer the agreement, Rockcliff Energy, Trace’s customer and Quantum’s associate, agreed to a long-term capacity assurance in support of Williams\\' Louisiana Energy Gateway (LEG) project. The project is designed to gather about 2 Bcf/d natural gas produced in Haynesville and link it to premium Transco markets, as well as liquefied natural gas export terminals, and industrial consumers situated on the Gulf Coast. (Williams to Acquire Trace Midstream\\'s Assets for $950M)\\r\\n\\r\\n4.\\xa0\\xa0 Italian integrated major Eni entered an agreement with its London-based peer BP plc to create Azule Energy — a 50/50 joint venture combining their Angola businesses.\\r\\n\\r\\nAzule Energy is expected to be the largest oil and gas producer in Angola, with stakes in 16 licenses and the Angola LNG joint venture. The JV could be beneficial to the country’s troubled oil industry.

The Company has relied on the exemptions from the valuation and minority shareholder approval requirements of MI 61-101 contained in sections 5.5(a), 5.5(b) and 5.7(1)(a) of MI 61-101, as the fair market value of the participation in the Redemption by insiders does not exceed 25% of the market capitalization of the Company, as determined in accordance with MI 61-101. The Company did not file a material change report in respect of the related party transaction at least 21 days before the closing of the Redemption, which the Company deems reasonable in the circumstances as the changes to the terms of the Preferred Shares were approved by Preferred Holders on March 11, 2022.\\n\\nABOUTCHRISTINA LAKE CANNABIS CORP.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nChristina Lake Cannabis is a licensed producer of cannabis under the Cannabis Act.

       "  'content': 'Shares in oilfield services firm Core Laboratories CLB slid more than 4% in extended trading after the company warned of falling earnings and revenues as the Russia-Ukraine crisis began to bite. Citing an impact on service revenues and product sales, the firm lowered its first-quarter revenue guidance to $110-$113 million from the prior $117-$122 million and its EPS view to 5-8 cents from 16-20 cents. Meanwhile, operating margin is now expected in the range of 5-6%, compared with 11% earlier. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe company said that cyberattacks on third -party units — prior to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine — hampered business by scuttling demand for crude-oil assay work, especially in Europe. According to CLB, such work continues to suffer in Europe, Russia and Ukraine as the war drags on. Core Laboratories further informed that it has put its Ukrainian operations on hold in order to protect workers, while suspending production sales delivery in the country. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition to the geopolitical risks, CLB suffered operational hiccups after a much larger-than-usual number of its employees tested positive for COVID during the first quarter. The surge in cases not only led to lockdowns and government-imposed curbs but also deferred certain client-backed projects. \\r\\n\\r\\nCore Laboratories is scheduled to report first-quarter results on Apr 27. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 18 cents per share on revenues of $121 million.\\r\\n\\r\\nConcurrent with the revised first -quarter guidance, Core Llaboratories also announced a deal involving a number of energy companies to provide carbon capture and sequestration (“‘CCS”’) solution. The project involves technical evaluation and assurance services for underground CCS study. To support this joint-industry consortium, CLB will be leveraging its technical knowhow in subsurface evaluation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Netherlands-based Core Laboratories deals with providing reservoir management and production enhancement services to the oil and gas companies.\\r\\n\\r\\nCLB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

       "  'title': 'Did Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) Use Debt To Deliver Its ROE Of 13%?',\n",
       "  'content': \"Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB).\\n\\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Core Laboratories\\n\\nHow To Calculate Return On Equity?\\n\\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\\n\\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\\n\\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Core Laboratories is:\\n\\n13% = US$20m ÷ US$161m (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2021).\\n\\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.13 in profit.\\n\\nDoes Core Laboratories Have A Good ROE?\\n\\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Core Laboratories has a similar ROE to the average in the Energy Services industry classification (11%). roe\\n\\nThat isn't amazing, but it is respectable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Core Laboratories by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.\\n\\nThe Importance Of Debt To Return On Equity\\n\\nCompanies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCombining Core Laboratories' Debt And Its 13% Return On Equity\\n\\nIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Core Laboratories, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.21. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.\\n\\nBut ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.\\n\\nBut note: Core Laboratories may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\\n\\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

CEST ON 28 APRIL 2022\\n\\nAMSTERDAM, March 16, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE: \"CLB US\" and Euronext Amsterdam: \"CLB NA\") (\"Core\", \"Core Lab\", or the \"Company\") is announcing revised guidance from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2022, as well as commencement of a joint-industry consortium project focused on carbon capture and sequestration (\"CCS\").\\n\\nREVISED Q1 2022 GUIDANCE\\n\\nThere have been two significant events impacting Core\\'s financial results since the Company provided its initial guidance for the first quarter of 2022 on 2 February 2022: (1) the outbreak of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 was much more significant than initially predicted; and (2) the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine.\\n\\nWith regards to the impact caused by the COVID-19 virus, disruptions reached an all-time high as the number of employees testing positive during the first quarter of 2022 has been five to six times higher than any previous period since the pandemic started. Approximately 15% of Core\\'s employees were impacted by either testing positive with COVID-19 or becoming subject to quarantine restrictions. This higher-than-expected surge in COVID-19 cases caused disruption to the Company\\'s operations and client-driven project delays, as well as government-imposed restrictions and lockdowns in multiple countries. Within Core Lab, these circumstances also resulted in significant employee overtime expense beyond levels initially projected for the first quarter of 2022. While both of Core\\'s business segments were affected, Reservoir Description was disproportionally impacted given its large headcount and global footprint. Fortunately, the majority of employee COVID-19 cases were mild and the number of new cases and associated quarantine effects have begun to decline in most regions outside of Europe and Asia Pacific.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe on-going geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine is also adversely impacting both service revenue and product sales during the first quarter, affecting both business segments. As part of Core\\'s global laboratory network, the Company provides analytical services on crude oil, natural gas and derived products, including both reservoir condition analysis and ambient condition assay work. Reservoir Description has been more heavily impacted, as business disruptions arising from cyber-attacks against third party facilities began prior to direct military engagement. These cyber-attacks disrupted demand for crude-oil assay work, particularly in Europe. With continuing direct military conflict in the region, disruptions in crude-oil assay work in Europe, Russia and Ukraine have persisted, as traditional supply chains associated with the movement of crude oil are realigning to new logistical patterns. Given that current global demand for crude oil and natural gas has not meaningfully diminished, Core Lab expects the supply lines to realign, and the Company\\'s associated laboratory services to resume in the near-term. However, Core Lab has suspended local Ukrainian operations to minimize risk to its employees. In addition, completion product sales delivered through Core\\'s Production Enhancement segment into Ukraine have also been suspended.\\n\\nCore\\'s revised guidance for the first quarter of 2022 revenue ranges from $110,000,000 to $113,000,000. Despite the events described above, which adversely impacted the financial performance of the Company for the first quarter of 2022, the Company maintained its commitment to fully reinstate employee salaries on 1 January 2022, consequently increasing operating expenses from previous quarters. The Company is now projecting operating margins to be approximately 5% to 6%, and Earnings Per Share (\"EPS\") to be between $0.05 to $0.08 for the first quarter of 2022. The Company\\'s 2022 outlook remains positive and projects a multi-year international cycle to unfold.\\n\\nCARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION CONSORTIUM\\n\\nCore Lab is pleased to announce the launch of a joint-industry Carbon Capture and Sequestration Consortium to analyze technical risks and challenges associated with subsurface carbon sequestration. As the number of carbon capture and sequestration projects expands, Core is leveraging its expertise in subsurface evaluation. The CCS Consortium, in collaboration with Dr. Birol Dindoruk of the University of Houston, has been formed to support global energy transition and decarbonization efforts. The Company hosted a project initiation meeting at its Houston, Texas Advanced Technology Center on 23 February 2022. The meeting was attended by technical representatives from an international panel of inaugural member companies, including: Chevron U.S.A. Inc., EOG Resources, Inc., JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corporation, Repsol Exploración S.A., Shell Exploration and Production Co., and Talos Low Carbon Solutions LLC.\\n\\nThe CCS Consortium combines Core\\'s decades of unparalleled global success in providing multi-client, joint-industry studies, with industry-leading rock and fluids-based reservoir characterization and optimization technologies. Core Lab is well positioned to deliver practical solutions that enhance its clients\\' ability to screen and evaluate prospective sites for subsurface CO2 sequestration, as well as improve Core\\'s clients\\' ability to develop and execute optimized operational strategies.\\n\\nLeveraging Core Lab\\'s considerable global expertise in reservoir characterization, the CCS Consortium will enhance the CCS industry\\'s assessment of the technical risks and challenges associated with geological sequestration of CO2. The CCS Consortium will focus on topics and considerations relating to reservoir capacity, injectivity, and containment integrity, as well as rock-fluid and fluid-fluid compatibility, all of which will be evaluated through directed programs of measurement, study and research.\\n\\nCore Lab will host its first quarter 2022 earnings call Thursday, 28 April 2022 at 7:30 a.m. CDT / 2:30 p.m. CEST to discuss financial and operational results. An earnings release will be issued after market close on 27 April 2022.\\n\\nCore Laboratories N.V. is a leading provider of proprietary and patented reservoir description and production enhancement services and products used to optimize reservoir performance. The Company has over 70 offices in more than 50 countries and is located in every major oil-producing province in the world.\\n\\nThis release, as well as other statements we made, includes forward-looking statements regarding the future revenue, profitability, business strategies and developments of the Company made in reliance upon the safe harbor provisions of Federal securities law. The Company\\'s outlook is subject to various important cautionary factors, including risks and uncertainties related to the oil and natural gas industry, business conditions, international markets, international political climates, public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and any related actions taken by businesses and governments, and other factors as more fully described in the Company\\'s most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

The jump came on an impressive volume with a higher-than-average number of shares changing hands in the session. This compares to the stock's 0.4% gain over the past four weeks.\\n\\nCore Laboratories stock ended sharply higher on Monday, driven by optimism over crude prices spurred by a supportive macro backdrop, geopolitical tensions and the OPEC+ supply curtailments.

This is attributable to an improvement in the overall business landscape for the company and year-over-year international revenues of more than 14%.

Moreover, segmental operating income of $7 million in the quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.20 million. The year-ago period reported an operating income of $4.5 million.

       "  'content': \"Core Laboratories (CLB) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.20 per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. This compares to earnings of $0.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\\n\\nA quarter ago, it was expected that this energy services company would post earnings of $0.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.18, delivering a surprise of -5.26%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.\\n\\nCore Laboratories , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $125.14 million for the quarter ended December 2021, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.52%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $113.75 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nCore Laboratories shares have added about 24.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's decline of -4.6%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Core Laboratories?\\n\\nWhile Core Laboratories has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Core Laboratories: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.21 on $126.57 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.06 on $540.03 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Field Services is currently in the top 21% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\\n\\nOne other stock from the same industry, Helix Energy (HLX), is yet to report results for the quarter ended December 2021.\\n\\nThis offshore oil and gas services contractor is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -900%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\\n\\nHelix Energy's revenues are expected to be $133.69 million, down 16.4% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: \"CLB US\" and Euronext Amsterdam: \"CLB NA\") (\"Core\", \"Core Lab\", or the \"Company\") reported fourth quarter 2021 revenue of $125,100,000. Core\\'s operating income was $14,200,000, yielding operating margins of 11%, with earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") of $0.06, all in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). EPS, ex-items, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $0.20. Income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2021 was elevated primarily due to significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and year-over-year comparisons are included in the attached financial tables.\\n\\nCore\\'s CEO, Larry Bruno stated, \"The fourth quarter of 2021 reflected the improvement in business landscape for Core Lab, led by year-over-year international revenue growth of over 14%. The Company recorded its highest revenue and EPS since the first quarter of 2020. At the same time, Core further strengthened its balance sheet, with the Company\\'s leverage ratio improving to the lowest level in seven quarters and approaching pre-pandemic levels. For 2022, we expect to see continued improvement in global market dynamics, particularly for Reservoir Description which takes longer to respond to inflections in market conditions compared to our Production Enhancement segment. Over the course of 2021, Core continued to roll out new products and services in key strategic geographic regions, positioning the Company for improving opportunities in both the U.S. and international markets. However, we anticipate typical seasonal declines in activity as we start the new year, and there are still short-term pandemic-related headwinds, as the sharp increase in virus cases in late 2021 has continued into early 2022. This has impacted operations through a combination of government-imposed lockdowns, delays in client projects and overtime costs to cover quarantine requirements among Core Lab staff. Fortunately, the recent COVID-19 illnesses experienced by our staff have largely been mild and of short duration, and we anticipate fewer COVID-related impacts as the year unfolds.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nReservoir Description\\n\\nReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels, with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from outside the U.S. Reservoir Description revenue in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $80,100,000, up 2% sequentially. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021 on a GAAP basis was $7,200,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $7,100,000, down 17% sequentially, yielding operating margins, ex-items, of 9%. Cost of operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased due to restoration of employee salary costs and continued operational inefficiencies associated with the global pandemic.\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Core began the initial work on a large, long-planned, reservoir evaluation project in the Middle East. This significant project had been delayed by local government-imposed shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019 and early 2020, Core Lab invested to expand analytical capabilities in the host country to service this extensive coring program and other emerging opportunities. The analytical program on this multi-well, conventional reservoir project will employ the full range of basic and advanced rock properties capabilities, including Core Lab proprietary methods and technologies. Work on this project will grow over the next few quarters and continue throughout 2022 and into 2023.\\n\\nAlso, during the fourth quarter of 2021, demand for subsurface evaluation services to support the oil and gas industry\\'s energy transition and decarbonization efforts continued to grow. As the quarter unfolded, Core Lab launched several client-directed laboratory analytical projects relating to Carbon Capture and Storage (\"CCS\"). Coordination and planning efforts are underway with a number of U.S. and international companies on projects aimed at evaluating potential sites for CO2 sequestration. Core Lab\\'s role in these projects is to evaluate the geologic, petrophysical and engineering aspects of the rocks and formation fluids, all critical inputs into modeling and identifying the subsurface risks unique to each potential sequestration site. During the quarter, Core Lab initiated a core evaluation program for an applied technology company on 180 feet of conventional core and associated sidewall cores from a potential sequestration site in Illinois, U.S. Core\\'s initial laboratory analytical program is needed to assess the reservoir and seal rock properties, and will also be used to form the foundation for determining the storage capacity of the stratigraphic target. As the project progresses, Core will utilize its advanced rock and fluid analytical technologies to refine the client\\'s understanding of this carbon sequestration opportunity and how to optimize CO2 injection methodologies.\\n\\nAnother emerging opportunity associated with energy transition involves leveraging Core\\'s proprietary, legacy portfolio of geological studies and fluid property datasets on conventional reservoirs and seal rock. Datasets, accessible through Core\\'s proprietary database platform, RAPIDTM, are proving invaluable to operators evaluating potential CCS sites in onshore and offshore Miocene and Oligocene reservoirs along the U.S. Gulf Coast. These legacy studies, originally conducted to evaluate hydrocarbon reservoirs, provide critical data for reconnaissance, benchmarking, and risk reduction ahead of new coring projects for CCS site assessment.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement\\n\\nProduction Enhancement operations, which are focused on complex completions in unconventional, tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S., as well as conventional offshore projects across the globe, posted fourth quarter 2021 revenue of $45,000,000, up 15% sequentially. While sequential financial performance was strong, growth opportunities were somewhat constrained during the quarter due to longer lead times in the supply chain and short supply of certain raw materials. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $7,000,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $7,100,000, up 43% sequentially. The improvement of fourth quarter 2021 operating margins to 16%, expanding 310 basis points sequentially, was underpinned by gains in manufacturing efficiencies, strong international sales, and continued market penetration of the Company\\'s pre-assembled GoGun® and Oriented GoGun®.\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Core Lab was approached by an operator conducting business in the Austin Chalk and Eagle Ford Formations to provide expertise when performing completions in smart wells. Smart wells, also referred to as \"intelligent wells\", utilize fiber optic cables attached to the outer wall of the casing, along with downhole sensors and valves which are run and cemented in place during the well completion. These sensors relay real time data through the fiber optic cable to the surface, allowing the operator to optimize production rates and make critical decisions on fracking, well spacing, and artificial lift programs. Following installation of the fiber optics, the well must still be perforated to create communication between the wellbore and the formation. These perforations are required for both frac stimulation and subsequent production. Precise alignment of the perforating system is critical to ensure that the fiber optic cables are not cut when the energetics are triggered. Cutting the cables would lead to a loss of communication with the down-hole sensors and valves. The operator selected Core\\'s proprietary Zero180™ Oriented Perforating System with Core\\'s HERO® PerFRAC charges for these smart wells. This perforating system and energetic design provides the most accurate oriented system available in the industry, yielding an advantage over competitive products whenever smart wells are being constructed. Core\\'s expertise supported the completion of over 50 stages without damage to the downhole smart well components.\\n\\nCore continues to innovate solutions for evaluating well completions and reducing well costs. During the fourth quarter of 2021, Core\\'s completion diagnostic services were called upon by multiple operators in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to provide a more efficient approach in identifying the top of cement on intermediate depth casing strings. Traditionally, the top of cement is determined by running cement bond logs, a time-consuming and costly process. Core\\'s completion diagnostic engineers, in conjunction with two major deepwater operators, developed a technique by which the top of the cement is marked with Core\\'s proprietary SpectraStim™ tracers. These tracers allow the operators to log the interval with their Logging While Drilling tools, thus eliminating the rig time and expense of running a separate cement bond log. The total cost savings realized by the operators were in excess of $150,000 per casing string. This application has now extended from two intermediate casing strings for the two original operators, to tracing three, and potentially four, intermediate casing strings. To date, this technology and resulting operational efficiency has been adopted by six deepwater operators.\\n\\nFree Cash Flow and Dividend\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Core continued to generate free cash flow (\"FCF\"), with cash from operations of $7,200,000 and capital expenditures of $4,800,000, yielding FCF of $2,400,000. As revenue and business activities increase, Core\\'s investment in working capital is also expected to increase. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter of 2021 also include $1,000,000 associated with repairs of damaged facilities which are covered by insurance. Core\\'s free cash will continue to be returned to its shareholders via the Company\\'s regular quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases, as well as being applied towards reducing long-term debt.\\n\\nOn 27 October 2021, Core\\'s Board of Supervisory Directors (\"Board\") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock, which was paid on 29 November 2021 to shareholders of record on 8 November 2021. Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nOn 2 February 2022, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable in the first quarter of 2022. The first quarter dividend will be payable on 7 March 2022, to shareholders of record on 14 February 2022. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nReturn On Invested Capital\\n\\nThe Board and the Company\\'s Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") and FCF, factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return. Core\\'s commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promote capital efficiency and are designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.\\n\\nThe Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core\\'s Comp Group by Bloomberg, as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. Bloomberg\\'s calculations using the latest comparable data available indicate that Core Lab\\'s ROIC of 9.8% is one of the highest for all major companies in the oilfield service Comp Group.\\n\\nIndustry and Core Lab Outlook and Guidance\\n\\nThe global crude-oil market continues to tighten, as demand for crude oil continues to approach pre-COVID levels, resulting in noticeable increases to crude-oil commodity prices. Current crude-oil commodity prices may also drive a higher level of investment, and urgency, in international offshore crude-oil development projects in 2022 and beyond. These crude-oil market fundamentals are reflected in the gradual increase in the international rig count, with more oilfield equipment coming under contract and expanded capital spending plans for 2022. Core sees this as a leading indicator of a growing international cycle.\\n\\nWith Core Lab having more than 70% of its revenue exposed to international activity, both business segments remain active on international projects. As additional field development projects emerge, wells need to be drilled and reservoir rock and fluid sampled before Reservoir Description more fully participates in the cycle. As pandemic disruptions abate, the expansion of international developments provides growth opportunities for both segments into 2022 and beyond, with a particular focus on the South Atlantic Margin, Latin America, and the Middle East.\\n\\nFor the first quarter of 2022, Core Lab expects lower client activity due to seasonality. The seasonal pattern typically results in a decline in first quarter revenue by mid-single digits. The projected decline in first quarter revenue is slightly less pronounced, compared to historical trends, as the Company expects momentum in U.S. land activity to continue. As such, Core anticipates typical seasonal effects to impact the first quarter of 2022, with first quarter revenue down low to mid-single digits, sequentially.\\n\\nCore projects first quarter 2022 revenue to range from $117,000,000 to $122,000,000 and operating income of $11,900,000 to $14,000,000, yielding operating margins of approximately 11%. EPS for the first quarter of 2022 is expected to be approximately $0.16 to $0.20.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s first quarter 2022 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. First quarter 2022 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.\\n\\nEarnings Call Scheduled\\n\\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core\\'s fourth quarter 2021 earnings announcement. The call will begin at 7:30 a.m. CST / 2:30 p.m. CET on Thursday, 3 February 2022.

       "  'title': 'Core Laboratories (NYSE:CLB) Will Be Hoping To Turn Its Returns On Capital Around',\n",
       "  'content': \"When we're researching a company, it's sometimes hard to find the warning signs, but there are some financial metrics that can help spot trouble early. Typically, we'll see the trend of both return on capital employed (ROCE) declining and this usually coincides with a decreasing amount of capital employed. This indicates the company is producing less profit from its investments and its total assets are decreasing. So after glancing at the trends within Core Laboratories (NYSE:CLB), we weren't too hopeful.\\n\\nWhat is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?\\n\\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Core Laboratories:\\n\\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\\n\\n0.085 = US$42m ÷ (US$586m - US$93m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2021).\\n\\nThus, Core Laboratories has an ROCE of 8.5%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return, but it's much better than the Energy Services industry average of 6.2%.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Core Laboratories  roce\\n\\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Core Laboratories compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our freereport for Core Laboratories.\\n\\nThe Trend Of ROCE\\n\\nIn terms of Core Laboratories' historical ROCE movements, the trend doesn't inspire confidence. About five years ago, returns on capital were 22%, however they're now substantially lower than that as we saw above. And on the capital employed front, the business is utilizing roughly the same amount of capital as it was back then. Companies that exhibit these attributes tend to not be shrinking, but they can be mature and facing pressure on their margins from competition. So because these trends aren't typically conducive to creating a multi-bagger, we wouldn't hold our breath on Core Laboratories becoming one if things continue as they have.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe Key Takeaway\\n\\nIn summary, it's unfortunate that Core Laboratories is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. We expect this has contributed to the stock plummeting 76% during the last five years. With underlying trends that aren't great in these areas, we'd consider looking elsewhere.\\n\\nOne more thing: We've identified  3 warning signs  with Core Laboratories (at least 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  , and understanding these would certainly be useful.\\n\\nWhile Core Laboratories may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

       "  'title': 'Core Laboratories (CLB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth',\n",
       "  'content': \"The market expects Core Laboratories (CLB) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2021. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.\\n\\nThe stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on February 2. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis energy services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.20 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.1%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $123.6 million, up 8.7% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Core Laboratories?\\n\\nFor Core Laboratories, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.\\n\\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Core Laboratories will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\\n\\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\\n\\nAnalysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\\n\\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Core Laboratories would post earnings of $0.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.18, delivering a surprise of -5.26%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\\n\\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\\n\\nCore Laboratories doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'content': \"Exxon Mobil Corporation’s XOM stake in the massive West Qurna 1 oilfield will be acquired by the Iraq National Oil Company after receiving approval from the country’s government for the acquisition.\\n\\nLocated in the southern part of Iraq, West Qurna 1 is one of the largest oilfields in the world, with expected recoverable reserves of more than 20 billion barrels. Operated by ExxonMobil, the oilfield has a production capacity of about 500,000 barrels per day.\\n\\nIn 2010, ExxonMobil was awarded a contract by Iraq to develop the West Qurna 1 oilfield. The company was among the first western oil explorers to enter Iraq as the country intended to redevelop its energy industry after years of conflict.\\n\\nLast year, ExxonMobil was planning to divest its 32.7% stake in the West Qurna oilfield as part of plans to reduce debt and increase cash flow. At that time, the Iraq ministry of oil claimed that the country was aiming to acquire the stake itself.\\n\\nAsset divestments are considered to be a crucial factor of ExxonMobil’s strategy to reduce debt and maintain its hefty dividend. XOM's divestment of its stake in West Qurna 1 would follow its 32% interest sale last year in a key exploration block in Iraq’s Kurdistan region. Foreign interest in developing oil and gas fields in southern Iraq has declined significantly as the country, together with other top producers, hampers production to support prices.\\n\\nCompany Profile & Price Performance\\n\\nHeadquartered in Irving, TX, ExxonMobil is one of the leading integrated energy companies in the world.\\n\\nShares of ExxonMobil have outperformed the industry in the past six months. The stock has gained 16.9% compared with the industry’s 15.9% growth.

Better news about the omicron coronavirus variant, strong U.S. jobs growth, and a drama-free OPEC+ meeting all boosted sentiment for demand, pointing to a scenario in which the omicron variant's impact on the economy would likely be less than feared.

       "  'content': \"Long term investing works well, but it doesn't always work for each individual stock. We don't wish catastrophic capital loss on anyone. Anyone who held Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) for five years would be nursing their metaphorical wounds since the share price dropped 81% in that time. We also note that the stock has performed poorly over the last year, with the share price down 21%. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 19% in the last 90 days. While a drop like that is definitely a body blow, money isn't as important as health and happiness.\\n\\nGiven the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn.\\n\\nView our latest analysis for Core Laboratories\\n\\nTo quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.\\n\\nDuring five years of share price growth, Core Laboratories moved from a loss to profitability. That would generally be considered a positive, so we are surprised to see the share price is down. Other metrics may better explain the share price move.\\n\\nWe don't think that the 0.2% is big factor in the share price, since it's quite small, as dividends go. It could be that the revenue decline of 5.1% per year is viewed as evidence that Core Laboratories is shrinking. That could explain the weak share price.\\n\\nThe image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail). earnings-and-revenue-growth\\n\\nWe know that Core Laboratories has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? You can see what analysts are predicting for Core Laboratories in this interactivegraph of future profit estimates.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nA Different Perspective\\n\\nCore Laboratories shareholders are down 21% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 21%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. However, the loss over the last year isn't as bad as the 12% per annum loss investors have suffered over the last half decade. We'd need to see some sustained improvements in the key metrics before we could muster much enthusiasm. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted  4 warning signs for Core Laboratories you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.\\n\\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this freelist of companies.

       "  'content': \"Shares of Core Laboratories N.V. CLB have gained 9.4% since the third-quarter 2021 earnings announcement on Oct 27.\\n\\nDespite this industry player’s earnings miss, its stock rose on the back of a strong future business trends as the momentum for the worldwide crude-oil markets progresses and oilfield activity advances.\\n\\nBehind the Earnings Headlines\\n\\nCore Labs reported third-quarter 2021 results wherein adjusted earnings of 18 cents a share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. This underperformance is attributable to lower-than-expected operating income from both the company’s segments due to hurricane-induced activity disruptions in the Gulf of Mexico, supply chain issues and international project delays. Rising operating expenses, which increased to $111.3 million from $94 million a year ago, also impacted results. However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 16 cents per share. This upside was attributable to the year-over-year increase in revenues of the production-enhancement segment.\\n\\nThis oilfield service provider’s adjusted revenues of $118 million missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%. However, the top line rose from the year-ago quarter’s revenues of $105.4 million.\\n\\nSegmental Performance\\n\\nReservoir Description: Revenues decreased 1.6% to $78.8 million from $80.1 million in third-quarter 2020 and also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $79 million, thanks to project delays related to the coronavirus pandemic and weather disruptions in the United States. Moreover, operating income fell from $11.02 million in the year-ago period to $4.43 million and also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 million. The operating margin of 11% was lower than the prior-year quarter’s 15%.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement: Revenues of $39.2 million compared favorably with $25.3 million a year earlier, attributable to manufacturing productivities and the penetration of unique energetic products and diagnostic services in both the U.S. and foreign markets. However, the same lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.5 million due to lower foreign product deliveries, which can fluctuate from quarter to quarter, and the stoppage of rig activities due to weather occurrences in the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAdditionally, due to lengthier supply-chain lead times and a shortage of some raw materials, growth possibilities were hindered throughout the quarter. Moreover, segmental operating income of $2.78 million in the quarter missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.6 million. The year-ago period reported an operating loss of $321,000.\\n\\nCore Laboratories N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Core Laboratories N.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nCore Laboratories N.V. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Core Laboratories N.V.

The company’s debt-to-capitalization was 53.9%.\\n\\nIn the reported quarter, Core Labs generated $11.9 million of operating cash and its capital expenditure totaled $3.1 million. This, in turn, led to an $8.8-million free cash flow (FCF) generation. This is the 80th consecutive quarter of the company’s FCF recognition.\\n\\nCore Labs’ board of directors approved a regular quarterly dividend of a cent per share on the company's common stock, payable Nov 29, 2021 to all its shareholders of record as of Nov 8, 2021.\\n\\n2021 View\\n\\nAs the momentum for international crude-oil markets steadily rises and U.S. activity continues to gradually ramp up, Core Labs remains confident about its growth possibilities for the remainder of 2021.\\n\\nFor the December quarter, Core Labs’ revenues are anticipated in the $121-$124 million range while operating income is estimated in the $13-$15 million band.\\n\\nAs Core Labs’ prospects are directly associated with expanding its client activity and tapping new geographies, mainly globally, it continues its focus on the ongoing development of new client-driven technologies and geographical exploration along with a deepened concentration on digitization and automation throughout its business.\\n\\nPerformance of Other Energy Players\\n\\nAmong other players in the oilfield services industry that already reported third-quarter earnings, the bottom-line results of Schlumberger SLB and Halliburton HAL matched the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate.\\n\\nZacks Rank & Key Pick\\n\\nCore Labs currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\\n\\nInvestors interested in the oilfield services space can look at a better-ranked option like TETRA Technologies, Inc.

       "  'title': 'Were Hedge Funds Right About CVR Energy, Inc. (CVI)?',\n",
       "  'content': \"In this article you are going to find out whether hedge funds think CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) is a good investment right now. We like to check what the smart money thinks first before doing extensive research on a given stock. Although there have been several high profile failed hedge fund picks, the consensus picks among hedge fund investors have historically outperformed the market after adjusting for known risk attributes. It's not surprising given that hedge funds have access to better information and more resources to predict the winners in the stock market.\\n\\nCVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) investors should be aware of a decrease in enthusiasm from smart money recently. CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) was in 16 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic is 31. There were 18 hedge funds in our database with CVI holdings at the end of March. Our calculations also showed that CVI isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings).\\n\\nSo, why do we pay attention to hedge fund sentiment before making any investment decisions? Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by more than 79 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We have been able to outperform the passive index funds by tracking the moves of corporate insiders and hedge funds, and we believe small investors can benefit a lot from reading hedge fund investor letters and 13F filings. Billionaire David Siegel's Top 10 Stock Picks\\n\\nDavid Siegel of Two Sigma Advisors\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, lithium prices have more than doubled over the past year, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best EV stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return. Even though we recommend positions in only a tiny fraction of the companies we analyze, we check out as many stocks as we can. We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. Now let's analyze the fresh hedge fund action encompassing CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI).\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nDo Hedge Funds Think CVI Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\\n\\nHeading into the third quarter of 2021, a total of 16 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were long this stock, a change of -11% from the previous quarter. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in CVI over the last 24 quarters. With the smart money's capital changing hands, there exists a select group of key hedge fund managers who were boosting their stakes substantially (or already accumulated large positions). Is CVI A Good Stock To Buy?\\n\\nThe largest stake in CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) was held by Icahn Capital LP, which reported holding $1278.7 million worth of stock at the end of June. It was followed by Millennium Management with a $17 million position. Other investors bullish on the company included Renaissance Technologies, Two Sigma Advisors, and Weiss Asset Management. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Icahn Capital LP allocated the biggest weight to CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI), around 5.26% of its 13F portfolio. SIR Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 0.73 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to CVI.\\n\\nDue to the fact that CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) has faced declining sentiment from the entirety of the hedge funds we track, it's easy to see that there exists a select few money managers that decided to sell off their entire stakes in the second quarter. Intriguingly, Brandon Haley's Holocene Advisors cut the biggest position of the 750 funds followed by Insider Monkey, totaling an estimated $2.5 million in stock, and Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP was right behind this move, as the fund said goodbye to about $0.8 million worth. These bearish behaviors are intriguing to say the least, as total hedge fund interest was cut by 2 funds in the second quarter.\\n\\nLet's check out hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) but similarly valued. We will take a look at WideOpenWest, Inc. (NYSE:WOW), Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT), Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. (NYSE:ARGO), Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB), Lindsay Corporation (NYSE:LNN), QAD Inc. (NASDAQ:QADA), and BioLife Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLFS). This group of stocks' market valuations are closest to CVI's market valuation.\\n\\n[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position WOW,19,296125,5 YEXT,19,54134,6 ARGO,12,230220,-1 CLB,16,238361,-1 LNN,14,215504,4 QADA,23,230920,9 BLFS,9,474531,-3 Average,16,248542,2.7 [/table]\\n\\nView table here if you experience formatting issues.\\n\\nAs you can see these stocks had an average of 16 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $249 million. That figure was $1348 million in CVI's case. QAD Inc. (NASDAQ:QADA) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand BioLife Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLFS) is the least popular one with only 9 bullish hedge fund positions. CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI) is not the least popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still below average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for CVI is 43.5. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly negative signal and we'd rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on. Our calculations showed that top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 29.6% in 2021 through November 5th and surpassed the market again by 3.1 percentage points.

       "  'content': 'How far off is Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we\\'ll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company\\'s future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they\\'re fairly easy to follow.\\n\\nRemember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company\\'s value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\\n\\nCheck out our latest analysis for Core Laboratories\\n\\nStep by step through the calculation\\n\\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company\\'s cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren\\'t available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\\n\\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today\\'s value:\\n\\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate\\n\\n2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$59.0m US$83.0m US$119.5m US$129.5m US$137.0m US$143.3m US$148.8m US$153.6m US$158.0m US$162.2m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x3 Analyst x3 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 5.76% Est @ 4.62% Est @ 3.82% Est @ 3.26% Est @ 2.87% Est @ 2.6% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4%  US$53.9 US$69.3 US$91.2 US$90.3 US$87.3 US$83.5 US$79.2 US$74.8 US$70.3 US$65.9\\n\\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\\r\\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$765m\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business\\'s cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today\\'s value at a cost of equity of 9.4%.\\n\\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2031 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$162m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.0%) = US$2.2b\\n\\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$2.2b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$901m\\n\\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.7b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$26.0, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\\n\\nThe assumptions\\n\\nWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don\\'t have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company\\'s future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company\\'s potential performance. Given that we are looking at Core Laboratories as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we\\'ve used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.703. Beta is a measure of a stock\\'s volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\\n\\nLooking Ahead:\\n\\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn\\'t be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

       "  'content': 'Hedge Funds and other institutional investors have just completed filing their 13Fs with the Securities and Exchange Commission, revealing their equity portfolios as of the end of June. At Insider Monkey, we follow nearly 900 active hedge funds and notable investors and by analyzing their 13F filings, we can determine the stocks that they are collectively bullish on. One of their picks is Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT), so let’s take a closer look at the sentiment that surrounds it in the current quarter.\\n\\nIs Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT) a buy right now? Money managers were getting more optimistic. The number of bullish hedge fund positions increased by 6 recently. Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT) was in 19 hedge funds\\' portfolios at the end of June. The all time high for this statistic is 23. Our calculations also showed that YEXT isn\\'t among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings). There were 13 hedge funds in our database with YEXT holdings at the end of March.\\n\\nWhy do we pay any attention at all to hedge fund sentiment? Our research has shown that a select group of hedge fund holdings outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 79 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). That\\'s why we believe hedge fund sentiment is an extremely useful indicator that investors should pay attention to.\\n\\nMichael Gelband of ExodusPoint Capital\\n\\nWith all of this in mind let\\'s take a glance at the new hedge fund action encompassing Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT).\\n\\nDo Hedge Funds Think YEXT Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\\n\\nAt Q2\\'s end, a total of 19 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey held long positions in this stock, a change of 46% from the previous quarter. On the other hand, there were a total of 10 hedge funds with a bullish position in YEXT a year ago. With the smart money\\'s capital changing hands, there exists an \"upper tier\" of notable hedge fund managers who were upping their stakes substantially (or already accumulated large positions).\\n\\nStory continues Is YEXT A Good Stock To Buy?\\n\\nAmong these funds, 0 held the most valuable stake in Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT), which was worth $14.7 million at the end of the second quarter. On the second spot was Marshall Wace LLP which amassed $8.3 million worth of shares. Citadel Investment Group, GLG Partners, and Renaissance Technologies were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position PDT Partners allocated the biggest weight to Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT), around 0.18% of its 13F portfolio. AlphaCrest Capital Management is also relatively very bullish on the stock, designating 0.09 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to YEXT.\\n\\nAs one would reasonably expect, key hedge funds have jumped into Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT) headfirst. Marshall Wace LLP, managed by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace, assembled the largest position in Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT). Marshall Wace LLP had $8.3 million invested in the company at the end of the quarter. Renaissance Technologies also made a $3.7 million investment in the stock during the quarter. The following funds were also among the new YEXT investors: Michael Gelband\\'s ExodusPoint Capital, Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell\\'s Arrowstreet Capital, and Paul Tudor Jones\\'s Tudor Investment Corp.\\n\\nLet\\'s now review hedge fund activity in other stocks - not necessarily in the same industry as Yext, Inc.

That figure was $54 million in YEXT\\'s case. The RealReal, Inc. (NASDAQ:REAL) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand BioLife Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:BLFS) is the least popular one with only 9 bullish hedge fund positions. Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT) is not the most popular stock in this group but hedge fund interest is still above average. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for YEXT is 64.2. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. This is a slightly positive signal but we\\'d rather spend our time researching stocks that hedge funds are piling on.

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.\\n\\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\\n\\nCore Laboratories shares have added about 4.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 21.8%.\\n\\nWhat's Next for Core Laboratories?\\n\\nWhile Core Laboratories has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\\n\\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\\n\\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Core Laboratories was unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\\n\\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.22 on $128.95 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $0.74 on $477.82 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.\\n\\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Oil and Gas - Field Services is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'content': '- REVENUE OF $118.0 MILLION\\n\\n- GAAP EPS OF $0.02; $0.18, EX-ITEMS\\n\\n- FREE CASH FLOW IMPROVES SEQUENTIALLY TO $8.8 MILLION\\n\\n- REDUCED NET DEBT BY $5.4 MILLION\\n\\n- ANNOUNCES Q4 2021 QUARTERLY DIVIDEND\\n\\nAMSTERDAM, Oct. 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE: \"CLB US\" and Euronext Amsterdam: \"CLB NA\") (\"Core\", \"Core Lab\", or the \"Company\") reported third quarter 2021 revenue of $118,000,000. Core\\'s operating income was $6,600,000, with earnings per diluted share (\"EPS\") of $0.02, all in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). Operating income, ex-items, a non-GAAP financial measure, was $13,000,000, yielding operating margins of 11% and EPS, ex-items, of $0.18. Third quarter 2021 results were adversely impacted by multiple weather events along the U.S. Gulf Coast, continued project delays due to COVID-19 in international markets and supply chain disruptions. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company recorded approximately $6,500,000 of non-cash stock compensation expense, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\", which requires full recognition of the award when an employee reaches their eligible retirement age. These long-term incentive awards remain fully subject to future vesting triggers based on the Company\\'s long-standing financial performance metrics. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures and year-over-year comparisons are included in the attached financial tables.\\n\\nCore\\'s CEO, Larry Bruno stated, \"Core continues to execute on its key strategic objectives by introducing new product and service offerings throughout our global network, and by posting sequential improvements in cash from operations and Free Cash Flow. At the same time, Core reduced net debt during the quarter, further improving the Company\\'s leverage ratio. Operationally, we continue to execute at a high level and were able to expand operating margins in both business segments during the quarter. However, back-to-back named storms along the U.S. Gulf Coast in the third quarter of 2021 adversely affected activity, causing prolonged shutdown of Core\\'s clients\\' offshore operations and extended power outages at several Company facilities. Additionally, pandemic-related travel restrictions and complications are still affecting the pace of international activity in the Middle East, Asia Pacific and South America regions. As a result of these on-going pandemic-related disruptions, the progress on international projects has been slower than anticipated, moderating expectations for the next several months. However, we see momentum building across all international regions and remain optimistic about the international outlook for 2022 and beyond.\"\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nReservoir Description\\n\\nReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with international and offshore activity levels, with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from outside the U.S. Reservoir Description revenue in the third quarter of 2021 was $79,000,000, up slightly sequentially. Operating income for the third quarter of 2021 on a GAAP basis was $4,400,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $8,600,000, up 14% sequentially, yielding operating margins, ex-items, of 11%, up 130 basis points sequentially. As previously noted, weather events in the U.S. and international pandemic-related complications adversely impacted third quarter 2021 performance.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, under the direction of the CarbonNet Project, Core Lab expanded the laboratory analytical program to include advanced rock and fluid testing on core samples from the Bass Straight, off the southeast coast of Australia. Core\\'s initial analytical program to access this CO2 sequestration opportunity, previously reported in the third quarter of 2020, characterized 300 feet of conventional core from the Gular-1 appraisal well. The expanded program employs Core Lab\\'s proprietary technologies to provide more detailed insight into pore system properties, rock-fluid compatibility, gas and liquid flow behavior, as well as geomechanical properties. The results of this advanced testing will further expand the CarbonNet Project\\'s understanding of the CO2 storage capacity, optimal CO2 injection methodologies and seal integrity, all of which are critical to understanding and reducing geologic risk associated with the project. These data sets will be used to evaluate CO2 injectivity over the life of the project, and to verify proper subsurface containment of the injected CO2. The biggest risk in evaluating any CO2 sequestration project is failing to properly assess the complexity of the targeted subsurface geologic formation and the in situ pore fluids. Core Lab\\'s expertise in evaluating subsurface geology and fluid flow through natural porous media is essential for accessing these types of CO2 sequestration projects.\\n\\nCore Lab continues to expand laboratory technologies in the Middle East region to meet client demand for rock and fluid laboratory analytical programs. Core remains a key partner by providing critical data sets for evaluating opportunities in both new and mature fields. During the third quarter of 2021, Core\\'s scientists were engaged by a National Oil Company to conduct a comprehensive study involving the analysis of reservoir fluids (crude oil, natural gas and formation water). The properties of these reservoir fluids at a range of subsurface temperature and pressure conditions must be precisely understood in order to predict hydrocarbon recovery over the life of the field. Pressure-Volume-Temperature (\"PVT\") data sets are used to determine the phase behavior of hydrocarbons at various reservoir stress conditions. As part of this analytical program, Core conducted advanced PVT studies to evaluate the potential injection options for a large-scale Enhanced Oil Recovery (\"EOR\") program. Although this field is naturally prolific, it is not exempt from physical laws affecting all reservoirs and their inevitable decline. Utilizing Core\\'s proprietary, fully visual PVT cells, Core\\'s scientists precisely determined changes in the physical and compositional properties of the hydrocarbons that will occur over the life of the field. The analytical program is enabling the operator to model reservoir performance, sustain current production levels and optimize ultimate recovery from the reservoir. Further work will be done to evaluate CO2 injection as a source of EOR.\\n\\nProduction Enhancement\\n\\nProduction Enhancement operations, which are focused on complex completions in unconventional, tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S., as well as conventional offshore projects across the globe, posted third quarter 2021 revenue of $39,200,000, down 3% sequentially. The sequential decline in revenue was primarily associated with lower international product shipments, which can vary from quarter to quarter, and the suspension of rig operations tied to weather events in the Gulf of Mexico. Additionally, growth opportunities were adversely impacted during the quarter due to longer lead times in the supply chain and short supply of certain raw materials. Operating income on a GAAP basis was $2,800,000, while operating income, ex-items, was $5,000,000, up 29% sequentially. The improvement of third quarter 2021 operating margins to 13%, expanding 320 basis points sequentially, was underpinned by gains in manufacturing efficiencies and continued market penetration of the Company\\'s pre-assembled GoGun™ and oriented GoGun™.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, Core\\'s Production Enhancement segment was approached by a client conducting business in the North Sea to provide plug and abandonment expertise to optimize a slot recovery process through a clean casing recovery program. The slot recovery is a technique that can be used to sidetrack existing wells, allowing access to additional crude oil from untapped or poorly drained reservoir sections, or well abandonment. The traditional method of milling and pulling the well\\'s casing during slot recovery can be costly and time-consuming. The client, after discussion with Core\\'s Production Enhancement engineers, decided to utilize Core\\'s proprietary Plug and Abandonment Perforating System (\"PAC™\"). PAC™ enables clean casing recovery, allowing for the efficient removal of interior casing strings without risking damage to the outer casing. The PAC™ technology employs an innovative, controlled energetic event that can be configured to penetrate anywhere from one to four casing strings without penetrating or compromising the outer casing. The circumferential coverage provided by the PAC™ technology enables the operator to establish circulation in the annular space between casing strings, facilitating wash operations and the efficient removal of the interior casing. Client feedback indicates the PAC™ system provided greater than 95% cleaning coverage of the annular space outside of the first casing string without compromising the second casing layer. Core\\'s expertise and technologies allowed for reduced rig time and efficient recovery of the interior casing, while eliminating risks and creating opportunities for production from untapped reservoir sections.\\n\\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, Core\\'s completion diagnostic services were called upon by a Permian Basin client to assess a new approach to cementing operations in its horizontal unconventional wells. It is difficult to maintain stage containment when fracing multi-stage laterals in which non-uniform cement placement has occurred. Non-uniform cement placement leaves channels behind pipe through which frac fluid can migrate between targeted intervals. Channels behind pipe can result in some targeted intervals being understimulated. The client wanted to evaluate if casing rotation while cementing would eliminate channels behind pipe. Core utilized its proprietary SpectraStim™ tracers and SpectraScan™ logging technologies to compare the degree of frac fluid containment in a well in which casing rotation was employed during the cementing operation. The well was then compared with adjacent wells in which no casing rotation had been employed. Core\\'s completion diagnostics engineers were able to confirm more uniform cement placement and better containment of frac fluid when pipe rotation was employed. In comparing oil production between the rotated pipe well and the wells in which no pipe rotation had been performed, the client observed an increase of 800 barrels of oil per 1000 feet of treated well in the first 80 days of production from the rotated pipe well. With these favorable results, the operator elected to implement pipe rotation in subsequent cementing operations. Core\\'s completion diagnostic technologies continue to assist operators in evaluating innovations in completion techniques.\\n\\nFree Cash Flow and Dividend\\n\\nCore continues to focus on generating free cash flow (\"FCF\"), a non-GAAP financial measure defined as cash from operations less capital expenditures. For the third quarter of 2021, cash from operations increased 25% sequentially to $11,900,000, with capital expenditures of $3,100,000, yielding $8,800,000 of FCF, up 33% sequentially. This marks another quarter in the Company\\'s long history of generating positive FCF.\\n\\nFor the third quarter of 2021, after funding the quarterly dividend, free cash was primarily used for reducing net debt by $5,400,000, or 3%, bringing Core\\'s leverage ratio (calculated as total net debt divided by trailing twelve months adjusted EBITDA) down to 2.10 as of 30 September 2021. Core will continue its strategy of applying excess free cash towards reducing the Company\\'s leverage ratio.\\n\\nOn 28 July 2021, Core\\'s Board of Supervisory Directors (\"Board\") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock, which was paid on 24 August 2021 to shareholders of record on 9 August 2021. Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nOn 27 October 2021, the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable in the fourth quarter of 2021. The fourth quarter dividend will be payable on 29 November 2021, to shareholders of record on 8 November 2021. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.\\n\\nReturn On Invested Capital\\n\\nThe Board and the Company\\'s Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (\"ROIC\") and FCF, factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return. Core\\'s commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promote capital efficiency and are designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.\\n\\nThe Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core\\'s Comp Group by Bloomberg, as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. As of 30 September 2021, Core Lab\\'s ROIC was 10.9% as calculated using the Bloomberg formula.\\n\\nIndustry and Core Lab Outlook and Guidance\\n\\nThe global crude-oil market continues to tighten, as demand for crude oil continues to approach pre-COVID levels, resulting in noticeable increases to crude-oil commodity prices. Current crude-oil commodity prices may also drive a higher level of investment, and urgency, in international offshore crude-oil development projects in 2022 and beyond. These crude-oil market fundamentals are reflected in the gradual increase in the international rig count, with more oilfield equipment coming under contract. Core sees this as a leading indicator of a growing international cycle.\\n\\nWith Core Lab having more than 70% of its revenue exposed to international activity, both business segments remain active on international projects. As additional field development projects emerge, wells need to be drilled and reservoir rock and fluid sampled before Reservoir Description more fully participates in the cycle. As pandemic disruptions abate, the expansion of international developments provides growth opportunities for both segments into 2022 and beyond, with a particular focus on the South Atlantic Margin, Latin America, and the Middle East.\\n\\nInternational revenue for the third quarter 2021 was up 9% year-over-year. For the fourth quarter 2021, Core sees continued growth in year-over-year international revenue. Additionally, U.S. activity is projected to continue to moderately progress as 2021 comes to a close.\\n\\nCore projects fourth quarter 2021 revenue to range from $121,000,000 to $124,000,000 and operating income of $13,000,000 to $15,500,000, yielding operating margins of approximately 12%. As previously stated in Core\\'s prior earnings calls, financial performance and incremental margins will be temporarily impacted as temporary cost reductions measures announced in 2020 continue to be reinstated. Once these costs are fully restored, Core expects its historical incremental margin performance to return as client activity expands. EPS for the fourth quarter of 2021 is expected to be approximately $0.18 to $0.22.\\n\\nThe Company\\'s fourth quarter 2021 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. Fourth quarter 2021 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.\\n\\nEarnings Call Scheduled\\n\\nThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core\\'s third quarter 2021 earnings announcement. The call will begin at 7:30 a.m. CDT / 2:30 p.m. CEST on Thursday, 28 October 2021.

       "  'content': 'Alger, an investment management firm, published its “Alger Weatherbie Specialized Growth Fund” third quarter 2021 investor letter – a copy of which can be downloaded here. During the third quarter, the largest portfolio sector weightings were Information Technology and Health Care. The largest sector overweight was Financials.

Core Laboratories is a unique oil services company that provides reservoir description and production enhancement services and products to the oil and gas industry. These services and products enable Core Laboratories’ clients to improve well performance and increase resource recovery from producing fields. During the quarter, many oil service stocks were weak due, in part, to the potential for reduced demand because of the lingering pandemic. Core Laboratories has not been immune to this pressure with many industry projects experiencing temporary delays as a result of country- or region-specific COVID-19 related restrictions.

We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017.

       "  'title': 'Core Laboratories (CLB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth',\n",
       "  'content': \"Core Laboratories (CLB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2021. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\\n\\nThe earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 27, 2021, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.\\n\\nWhile management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.\\n\\nZacks Consensus Estimate\\n\\nThis energy services company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.19 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.8%.\\n\\nRevenues are expected to be $122.9 million, up 16.6% from the year-ago quarter.\\n\\nEstimate Revisions Trend\\n\\nThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.\\n\\nInvestors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.\\n\\nPrice, Consensus and EPS Surprise\\n\\nEarnings Whisper\\n\\nEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).\\n\\nThe Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.\\n\\nA positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.\\n\\nPlease note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).\\n\\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Core Laboratories?\\n\\nFor Core Laboratories, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.71%.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.\\n\\nSo, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Core Laboratories will beat the consensus EPS estimate.\\n\\nDoes Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?\\n\\nWhile calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.\\n\\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Core Laboratories would post earnings of $0.19 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.18, delivering a surprise of -5.26%.\\n\\nOver the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.\\n\\nBottom Line\\n\\nAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.\\n\\nThat said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.\\n\\nCore Laboratories doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.\\n\\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

       "  'title': 'Hedge Funds Are Selling Great Western Bancorp Inc (GWB)',\n",
       "  'content': \"At Insider Monkey, we pore over the filings of nearly 873 top investment firms every quarter, a process we have now completed for the latest reporting period. The data we've gathered as a result gives us access to a wealth of collective knowledge based on these firms' portfolio holdings as of June 30th. In this article, we will use that wealth of knowledge to determine whether or not Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB) makes for a good investment right now.\\n\\nIs Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB) a cheap stock to buy now? Money managers were taking a pessimistic view. The number of bullish hedge fund positions were trimmed by 3 in recent months. Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB) was in 10 hedge funds' portfolios at the end of the second quarter of 2021. The all time high for this statistic is 24. Our calculations also showed that GWB isn't among the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds (click for Q2 rankings). There were 13 hedge funds in our database with GWB holdings at the end of March.\\n\\nHedge funds' reputation as shrewd investors has been tarnished in the last decade as their hedged returns couldn't keep up with the unhedged returns of the market indices. Our research has shown that hedge funds' small-cap stock picks managed to beat the market by double digits annually between 1999 and 2016, but the margin of outperformance has been declining in recent years. Nevertheless, we were still able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs by 79 percentage points since March 2017 (see the details here). We were also able to identify in advance a select group of hedge fund holdings that underperformed the market by 10 percentage points annually between 2006 and 2017. Interestingly the margin of underperformance of these stocks has been increasing in recent years. Investors who are long the market and short these stocks would have returned more than 27% annually between 2015 and 2017. We have been tracking and sharing the list of these stocks since February 2017 in our quarterly newsletter.\\n\\nStory continues Matthew Lindenbaum Basswood Capital\\n\\nMatthew Lindenbaum of Basswood Capital\\n\\nAt Insider Monkey, we scour multiple sources to uncover the next great investment idea. For example, lithium mining is one of the fastest growing industries right now, so we are checking out stock pitches like this emerging lithium stock. We go through lists like the 10 best EV stocks to pick the next Tesla that will deliver a 10x return.

We read hedge fund investor letters and listen to stock pitches at hedge fund conferences. You can subscribe to our free daily newsletter on our homepage. With all of this in mind let's take a peek at the fresh hedge fund action encompassing Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB).\\n\\nDo Hedge Funds Think GWB Is A Good Stock To Buy Now?\\n\\nAt the end of the second quarter, a total of 10 of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on this stock, a change of -23% from the first quarter of 2020. The graph below displays the number of hedge funds with bullish position in GWB over the last 24 quarters. So, let's check out which hedge funds were among the top holders of the stock and which hedge funds were making big moves. Is GWB A Good Stock To Buy?\\n\\nMore specifically, Basswood Capital was the largest shareholder of Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB), with a stake worth $6.5 million reported as of the end of June. Trailing Basswood Capital was D E Shaw, which amassed a stake valued at $2.8 million. Two Sigma Advisors, Millennium Management, and Royce & Associates were also very fond of the stock, becoming one of the largest hedge fund holders of the company. In terms of the portfolio weights assigned to each position Quantinno Capital allocated the biggest weight to Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB), around 0.32% of its 13F portfolio. Basswood Capital is also relatively very bullish on the stock, dishing out 0.27 percent of its 13F equity portfolio to GWB.\\n\\nJudging by the fact that Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB) has experienced falling interest from the aggregate hedge fund industry, it's safe to say that there is a sect of fund managers that slashed their entire stakes heading into Q3. At the top of the heap, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group dropped the largest investment of all the hedgies tracked by Insider Monkey, worth an estimated $10.4 million in stock, and Peter Rathjens, Bruce Clarke and John Campbell's Arrowstreet Capital was right behind this move, as the fund dropped about $2.5 million worth. These moves are important to note, as aggregate hedge fund interest dropped by 3 funds heading into Q3.\\n\\nLet's now review hedge fund activity in other stocks similar to Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB). We will take a look at CVR Energy, Inc. (NYSE:CVI), WideOpenWest, Inc. (NYSE:WOW), Yext, Inc. (NYSE:YEXT), Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. (NYSE:ARGO), Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB), Lindsay Corporation (NYSE:LNN), and QAD Inc. (NASDAQ:QADA). This group of stocks' market valuations are similar to GWB's market valuation.\\n\\n[table] Ticker, No of HFs with positions, Total Value of HF Positions (x1000), Change in HF Position CVI,16,1348329,-2 WOW,19,296125,5 YEXT,19,54134,6 ARGO,12,230220,-1 CLB,16,238361,-1 LNN,14,215504,4 QADA,23,230920,9 Average,17,373370,2.9 [/table]\\n\\nView table here if you experience formatting issues.\\n\\nAs you can see these stocks had an average of 17 hedge funds with bullish positions and the average amount invested in these stocks was $373 million. That figure was $14 million in GWB's case. QAD Inc. (NASDAQ:QADA) is the most popular stock in this table. On the other hand Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd. (NYSE:ARGO) is the least popular one with only 12 bullish hedge fund positions. Compared to these stocks Great Western Bancorp Inc (NYSE:GWB) is even less popular than ARGO. Our overall hedge fund sentiment score for GWB is 14.5. Stocks with higher number of hedge fund positions relative to other stocks as well as relative to their historical range receive a higher sentiment score. Hedge funds dodged a bullet by taking a bearish stance towards GWB. Our calculations showed that the top 5 most popular hedge fund stocks returned 95.8% in 2019 and 2020, and outperformed the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) by 40 percentage points. These stocks gained 25.7% in 2021 through September 27th but managed to beat the market again by 6.2 percentage points. Unfortunately GWB wasn't nearly as popular as these 5 stocks (hedge fund sentiment was very bearish); GWB investors were disappointed as the stock returned -0.9% since the end of the second quarter (through 9/27) and underperformed the market. If you are interested in investing in large cap stocks with huge upside potential, you should check out the top 5 most popular stocks among hedge funds as most of these stocks already outperformed the market since 2019.\\n\\nGet real-time email alerts: Follow Great Western Bancorp Inc.

       "  'title': 'Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB) Delivered A Better ROE Than Its Industry',\n",
       "  'content': \"While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE:CLB).\\n\\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\\n\\nSee our latest analysis for Core Laboratories\\n\\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\\n\\nThe formula for ROE is:\\n\\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\\n\\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Core Laboratories is:\\n\\n22% = US$33m ÷ US$154m (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2021).\\n\\nThe 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.22.\\n\\nDoes Core Laboratories Have A Good Return On Equity?\\n\\nOne simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Core Laboratories has a better ROE than the average (6.8%) in the Energy Services industry. roe\\n\\nThat's clearly a positive. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Especially when a firm uses high levels of debt to finance its debt which may boost its ROE but the high leverage puts the company at risk. To know the 4 risks we have identified for Core Laboratories visit our risks dashboard for free.\\n\\nHow Does Debt Impact ROE?\\n\\nVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.\\n\\nStory continues\\n\\nCombining Core Laboratories' Debt And Its 22% Return On Equity\\n\\nCore Laboratories clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.38. There's no doubt its ROE is decent, but the very high debt the company carries is not too exciting to see. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.\\n\\nHaving said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\\n\\nOf course Core Laboratories may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of other companies that have high ROE and low debt.\\n\\nThis article by Simply Wall St is general in nature.
